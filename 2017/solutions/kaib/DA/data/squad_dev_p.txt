denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with peyton manning completing an 18 yard pass to tight end owen daniels and a 22 yard throw to receiver andre caldwell a pair of carries by c j anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the panthers 14 yard line , but carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays first , linebacker shaq thompson tackled ronnie hillman for a 3 yard loss then after an incompletion , thomas davis tackled anderson for a 1 yard gain on third down , forcing denver to settle for a 3 0 lead on a brandon mcmanus 34 yard field goal the score marked the first time in the entire postseason that carolina was facing a deficit
after each team punted , panthers quarterback cam newton appeared to complete a 24 yard pass jerricho cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge cbs analyst and retired referee mike carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete a few plays later , on 3rd and 10 from the 15 yard line , linebacker von miller knocked the ball out of newton 's hands while sacking him , and malik jackson recovered it in the end zone for a broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10 0 lead this was the first fumble return touchdown in a super bowl since super bowl xxviii at the end of the 1993 season
after a punt from both teams , carolina got on track with a 9 play , 73 yard scoring drive newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while jonathan stewart finished the drive with a 1 yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10 7 with 11 28 left in the second quarter later on , broncos receiver jordan norwood received brad nortman 's short 28 yard punt surrounded by panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking norwood had called a fair catch norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a super bowl record 61 yard return before mario addison dragged him down on the panthers 14 yard line despite denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so mcmanus kicked a 33 yard field goal that increased their lead to 13 7
on carolina 's next possession fullback mike tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety darian stewart , which linebacker danny trevathan recovered on the broncos 40 yard line however , the panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end kony ealy tipped a manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the panthers 39 yard line with 1 55 left on the clock the panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt after a denver punt , carolina drove to the broncos 45 yard line but with 11 seconds left , newton was sacked by demarcus ware as time expired in the half
the panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when newton completed a 45 yard pass to ted ginn jr on the denver 35 yard line on their second offensive play but the broncos defense halted the drive on the 26 yard line , and it ended with no points when graham gano hit the uprights on a 44 yard field goal attempt after the miss , manning completed a pair of passes to emmanuel sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up mcmanus' 33 yard field goal that gave the broncos a 16 7 lead carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with newton completing a 42 yard pass to corey brown but once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a newton pass that bounced off the hands of ginn and was intercepted by safety t j ward ward fumbled the ball during the return , but trevathan recovered it to enable denver to keep possession
there would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the broncos drove to the panthers 41 yard line on the next play , ealy knocked the ball out of manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for carolina on the 50 yard line a 16 yard reception by devin funchess and a 12 yard run by stewart then set up gano 's 39 yard field goal , cutting the panthers deficit to one score at 16 10 the next three drives of the game would end in punts
with 4 51 left in regulation , carolina got the ball on their own 24 yard line with a chance to mount a game winning drive , and soon faced 3rd and 9 on the next play , miller stripped the ball away from newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by ward , who returned it five yards to the panthers 4 yard line although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism meanwhile , denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback josh norman gave the broncos a new set of downs then anderson scored on a 2 yard touchdown run and manning completed a pass to bennie fowler for a 2 point conversion , giving denver a 24 10 lead with 3 08 left and essentially putting the game away carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one
manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception and zero touchdowns sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards anderson was the game 's leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown , along with four receptions for 10 yards miller had six total tackles \( five solo \) , 2 sacks , and two forced fumbles ware had five total tackles and two sacks ward had seven total tackles , a fumble recovery , and an interception mcmanus made all four of his field goals , making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post season newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards , with one interception he was also the team 's leading rusher with 45 yards on six carries brown caught four passes for 80 yards , while ginn had four receptions for 74 ealy was the top defensive performer for carolina with four total tackles , three sacks , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , and an interception defensive end charles johnson had four total tackles , a sack , and a forced fumble linebacker luke kuechly had 11 total tackles , while thomas davis had seven , despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the nfc title game

warsaw 's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country during the second world war , warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction after liberation , rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist ruled prl most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed however , some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s \( e g leopold kronenberg palace \) mass residential blocks were erected , with basic design typical of eastern bloc countries

exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war \( like mentioned kronenberg palace and insurance company rosja building \) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style \( like warsaw philharmony edifice originally inspired by palais garnier in paris \) despite that the warsaw university of technology building \( 1899 1902 \) is the most interesting of the late 19th century architecture some 19th century buildings in the praga district \( the vistula s right bank \) have been restored although many have been poorly maintained warsaw s municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the saxon palace and the br hl palace , the most distinctive buildings in prewar warsaw

the flora of the city may be considered very rich in species the species richness is mainly due to the location of warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close to wilderness areas \( natural forests , wetlands along the vistula \) as well as arable land , meadows and forests bielany forest , located within the borders of warsaw , is the remaining part of the masovian primeval forest bielany forest nature reserve is connected with kampinos forest it is home to rich fauna and flora within the forest there are three cycling and walking trails other big forest area is kabaty forest by the southern city border warsaw has also two botanic gardens by the azienki park \( a didactic research unit of the university of warsaw \) as well as by the park of culture and rest in powsin \( a unit of the polish academy of science \)
in 1939 , c 1 , 300 , 000 people lived in warsaw , but in 1945 only 420 , 000 during the first years after the war , the population growth was c 6 , so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses the first remedial measure was the warsaw area enlargement \( 1951 \) but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance \( like renowned specialists \) were allowed to get the registration , hence halving the population growth in the following years it also bolstered some kind of conviction among poles that varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital unfortunately this belief still lives on in poland \( although not as much as it used to be \) even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore
throughout its existence , warsaw has been a multi cultural city according to the 1901 census , out of 711 , 988 inhabitants 56 2 were catholics , 35 7 jews , 5 greek orthodox christians and 2 8 protestants eight years later , in 1909 , there were 281 , 754 jews \( 36 9 \) , 18 , 189 protestants \( 2 4 \) and 2 , 818 mariavites \( 0 4 \) this led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the warsaw uprising of 1944 after the war , the new communist authorities of poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt
the basic unit of territorial division in poland is a commune \( gmina \) a city is also a commune but with the city charter both cities and communes are governed by a mayor but in the communes the mayor is vogt \( w jt in polish \) , however in the cities burmistrz some bigger cities obtain the entitlements , i e tasks and privileges , which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division counties or powiats an example of such entitlement is a car registration a gmina cannot register cars , this is a powiat 's task \( i e a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered , not gmina \) in this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki such cities are for example lublin , krak w , gda sk , pozna in warsaw , its districts additionally have some of powiat 's entitlements like already mentioned car registration for example , the district wola has its own evidence and the district ursyn w its own \( and the cars from wola have another type of registration number than these from ursyn w \) but for instance the districts in krak w do not have entitlements of powiat , so the registration numbers in krak w are of the same type for all districts

the normans \( norman nourmands french normands latin normanni \) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy , a region in france they were descended from norse \( norman comes from norseman \) raiders and pirates from denmark , iceland and norway who , under their leader rollo , agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native frankish and roman gaulish populations , their descendants would gradually merge with the carolingian based cultures of west francia the distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries
the norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval europe and even the near east the normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their christian piety , becoming exponents of the catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated they adopted the gallo romance language of the frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as norman , normaund or norman french , an important literary language the duchy of normandy , which they formed by treaty with the french crown , was a great fief of medieval france , and under richard i of normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure the normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations norman adventurers founded the kingdom of sicily under roger ii after conquering southern italy on the saracens and byzantines , and an expedition on behalf of their duke , william the conqueror , led to the norman conquest of england at the battle of hastings in 1066 norman cultural and military influence spread from these new european centres to the crusader states of the near east , where their prince bohemond i founded the principality of antioch in the levant , to scotland and wales in great britain , to ireland , and to the coasts of north africa and the canary islands
the english name normans comes from the french words normans normanz , plural of normant , modern french normand , which is itself borrowed from old low franconian nortmann northman or directly from old norse nor ma r , latinized variously as nortmannus , normannus , or nordmannus \( recorded in medieval latin , 9th century \) to mean norseman , viking
in the course of the 10th century , the initially destructive incursions of norse war bands into the rivers of france evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property the duchy of normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of saint clair sur epte between king charles iii of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo , and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria the treaty offered rollo and his men the french lands between the river epte and the atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further viking incursions the area corresponded to the northern part of present day upper normandy down to the river seine , but the duchy would eventually extend west beyond the seine the territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of rouen , and reproduced the roman administrative structure of gallia lugdunensis ii \( part of the former gallia lugdunensis \)
before rollo 's arrival , its populations did not differ from picardy or the le de france , which were considered frankish earlier viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s , but were divided between colonies in the east \( roumois and pays de caux \) around the low seine valley and in the west in the cotentin peninsula , and were separated by traditional pagii , where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers rollo 's contingents who raided and ultimately settled normandy and parts of the atlantic coast included danes , norwegians , norse gaels , orkney vikings , possibly swedes , and anglo danes from the english danelaw under norse control
the descendants of rollo 's vikings and their frankish wives would replace the norse religion and old norse language with catholicism \( christianity \) and the gallo romance language of the local people , blending their maternal frankish heritage with old norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique norman culture in the north of france the norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'o l branch of romance by a norse speaking ruling class , and it developed into the regional language that survives today
the normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of france , and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both normandy and in england the new norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old french aristocracy , most of whom traced their lineage to franks of the carolingian dynasty most norman knights remained poor and land hungry , and by 1066 normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation many normans of italy , france and england eventually served as avid crusaders under the italo norman prince bohemund i and the anglo norman king richard the lion heart
opportunistic bands of normans successfully established a foothold in southern italy \( the mezzogiorno \) probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories , the normans entered the mezzogiorno as warriors in 1017 at the latest in 999 , according to amatus of montecassino , norman pilgrims returning from jerusalem called in at the port of salerno when a saracen attack occurred the normans fought so valiantly that prince guaimar iii begged them to stay , but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the prince 's request william of apulia tells that , in 1016 , norman pilgrims to the shrine of the archangel michael at monte gargano were met by melus of bari , a lombard nobleman and rebel , who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the byzantine rule , which they did
the two most prominent norman families to arrive in the mediterranean were descendants of tancred of hauteville and the drengot family , of whom rainulf drengot received the county of aversa , the first norman toehold in the south , from duke sergius iv of naples in 1030 the hauteville family achieved princely rank by proclaiming prince guaimar iv of salerno duke of apulia and calabria he promptly awarded their elected leader , william iron arm , with the title of count in his capital of melfi the drengot family thereafter attained the principality of capua , and emperor henry iii legally ennobled the hauteville leader , drogo , as dux et magister italiae comesque normannorum totius apuliae et calabriae \( duke and master of italy and count of the normans of all apulia and calabria \) in 1047
from these bases , the normans eventually captured sicily and malta from the saracens , under the leadership of the famous robert guiscard , a hauteville , and his younger brother roger the great count roger 's son , roger ii of sicily , was crowned king in 1130 \( exactly one century after rainulf was crowned count \) by antipope anacletus ii the kingdom of sicily lasted until 1194 , when it was transferred to the house of hohenstaufen through marriage the normans left their legacy in many castles , such as william iron arm 's citadel at squillace , and cathedrals , such as roger ii 's cappella palatina chapel at palermo , which dot the landscape and give a wholly distinct architectural flavor to accompany its unique history
institutionally , the normans combined the administrative machinery of the byzantines , arabs , and lombards with their own conceptions of feudal law and order to forge a unique government under this state , there was great religious freedom , and alongside the norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of jews , muslims and christians , both catholic and eastern orthodox the kingdom of sicily thus became characterized by norman , byzantine greek , arab , lombard and native sicilian populations living in harmony , and its norman rulers fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed fatimid egypt as well as the crusader states in the levant one of the great geographical treatises of the middle ages , the tabula rogeriana , was written by the andalusian al idrisi for king roger ii of sicily , and entitled kitab rudjdjar \( the book of roger \)
soon after the normans began to enter italy , they entered the byzantine empire and then armenia , fighting against the pechenegs , the bulgars , and especially the seljuk turks norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the lombards to act against the byzantines , but they soon fought in byzantine service in sicily they were prominent alongside varangian and lombard contingents in the sicilian campaign of george maniaces in 1038 40 there is debate whether the normans in greek service actually were from norman italy , and it now seems likely only a few came from there it is also unknown how many of the franks , as the byzantines called them , were normans and not other frenchmen
one of the first norman mercenaries to serve as a byzantine general was herv in the 1050s by then however , there were already norman mercenaries serving as far away as trebizond and georgia they were based at malatya and edessa , under the byzantine duke of antioch , isaac komnenos in the 1060s , robert crispin led the normans of edessa against the turks roussel de bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in asia minor with support from the local population , but he was stopped by the byzantine general alexius komnenos
some normans joined turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the armenians vassal states of sassoun and taron in far eastern anatolia later , many took up service with the armenian state further south in cilicia and the taurus mountains a norman named oursel led a force of franks into the upper euphrates valley in northern syria from 1073 to 1074 , 8 , 000 of the 20 , 000 troops of the armenian general philaretus brachamius were normans formerly of oursel led by raimbaud they even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle afranji , meaning franks the known trade between amalfi and antioch and between bari and tarsus may be related to the presence of italo normans in those cities while amalfi and bari were under norman rule in italy
several families of byzantine greece were of norman mercenary origin during the period of the comnenian restoration , when byzantine emperors were seeking out western european warriors the raoulii were descended from an italo norman named raoul , the petraliphae were descended from a pierre d'aulps , and that group of albanian clans known as the maniakates were descended from normans who served under george maniaces in the sicilian expedition of 1038
robert guiscard , an other norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of apulia as the result of his military successes , ultimately drove the byzantines out of southern italy having obtained the consent of pope gregory vii and acting as his vassal , robert continued his campaign conquering the balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the catholic church after allying himself with croatia and the catholic cities of dalmatia , in 1081 he led an army of 30 , 000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of albania , capturing valona , kanina , jericho \( orikumi \) , and reaching butrint after numerous pillages they joined the fleet that had previously conquered corfu and attacked dyrrachium from land and sea , devastating everything along the way under these harsh circumstances , the locals accepted the call of emperor alexius i comnenus to join forces with the byzantines against the normans the albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival immediately before the battle , the venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city forced to retreat , alexius ceded the command to a high albanian official named comiscortes in the service of byzantium the city 's garrison resisted until february 1082 , when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there the normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland they took ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern macedonia and thessaly before appearing at the gates of thessalonica dissension among the high ranks coerced the normans to retreat to italy they lost dyrrachium , valona , and butrint in 1085 , after the death of robert
a few years after the first crusade , in 1107 , the normans under the command of bohemond , robert 's son , landed in valona and besieged dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time , but to no avail meanwhile , they occupied petrela , the citadel of mili at the banks of the river deabolis , gllavenica \( ballsh \) , kanina and jericho this time , the albanians sided with the normans , dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the byzantines had imposed upon them with their help , the normans secured the arbanon passes and opened their way to dibra the lack of supplies , disease and byzantine resistance forced bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the byzantines in the city of deabolis
the further decline of byzantine state of affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185 , when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium , owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials some time later , dyrrachium one of the most important naval bases of the adriatic fell again to byzantine hands
the normans were in contact with england from an early date not only were their original viking brethren still ravaging the english coasts , they occupied most of the important ports opposite england across the english channel this relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of emma , sister of duke richard ii of normandy , and king ethelred ii of england because of this , ethelred fled to normandy in 1013 , when he was forced from his kingdom by sweyn forkbeard his stay in normandy \( until 1016 \) influenced him and his sons by emma , who stayed in normandy after cnut the great 's conquest of the isle
when finally edward the confessor returned from his father 's refuge in 1041 , at the invitation of his half brother harthacnut , he brought with him a norman educated mind he also brought many norman counsellors and fighters , some of whom established an english cavalry force this concept never really took root , but it is a typical example of the attitudes of edward he appointed robert of jumi ges archbishop of canterbury and made ralph the timid earl of hereford he invited his brother in law eustace ii , count of boulogne to his court in 1051 , an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between saxon and norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of earl godwin of wessex
in 1066 , duke william ii of normandy conquered england killing king harold ii at the battle of hastings the invading normans and their descendants replaced the anglo saxons as the ruling class of england the nobility of england were part of a single normans culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel early norman kings of england , as dukes of normandy , owed homage to the king of france for their land on the continent they considered england to be their most important holding \( it brought with it the title of king an important status symbol \)
eventually , the normans merged with the natives , combining languages and traditions in the course of the hundred years' war , the norman aristocracy often identified themselves as english the anglo norman language became distinct from the latin language , something that was the subject of some humour by geoffrey chaucer the anglo norman language was eventually absorbed into the anglo saxon language of their subjects \( see old english \) and influenced it , helping \( along with the norse language of the earlier anglo norse settlers and the latin used by the church \) in the development of middle english it in turn evolved into modern english
the normans had a profound effect on irish culture and history after their invasion at bannow bay in 1169 initially the normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity yet , with time , they came to be subsumed into irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became more irish than the irish themselves the normans settled mostly in an area in the east of ireland , later known as the pale , and also built many fine castles and settlements , including trim castle and dublin castle both cultures intermixed , borrowing from each other 's language , culture and outlook norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames names such as french , \( de \) roche , devereux , d'arcy , treacy and lacy are particularly common in the southeast of ireland , especially in the southern part of county wexford where the first norman settlements were established other norman names such as furlong predominate there another common norman irish name was morell \( murrell \) derived from the french norman name morel other names beginning with fitz \( from the norman for son \) indicate norman ancestry these included fitzgerald , fitzgibbons \( gibbons \) dynasty , fitzmaurice other families bearing such surnames as barry \( de barra \) and de b rca \( burke \) are also of norman extraction
one of the claimants of the english throne opposing william the conqueror , edgar atheling , eventually fled to scotland king malcolm iii of scotland married edgar 's sister margaret , and came into opposition to william who had already disputed scotland 's southern borders william invaded scotland in 1072 , riding as far as abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships malcolm submitted , paid homage to william and surrendered his son duncan as a hostage , beginning a series of arguments as to whether the scottish crown owed allegiance to the king of england
normans came into scotland , building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings , such as robert the bruce , as well as founding a considerable number of the scottish clans king david i of scotland , whose elder brother alexander i had married sybilla of normandy , was instrumental in introducing normans and norman culture to scotland , part of the process some scholars call the davidian revolution having spent time at the court of henry i of england \( married to david 's sister maud of scotland \) , and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half brother m el coluim mac alaxandair , david had to reward many with lands the process was continued under david 's successors , most intensely of all under william the lion the norman derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of scotland scottish families of the names bruce , gray , ramsay , fraser , ogilvie , montgomery , sinclair , pollock , burnard , douglas and gordon to name but a few , and including the later royal house of stewart , can all be traced back to norman ancestry
even before the norman conquest of england , the normans had come into contact with wales edward the confessor had set up the aforementioned ralph as earl of hereford and charged him with defending the marches and warring with the welsh in these original ventures , the normans failed to make any headway into wales
subsequent to the conquest , however , the marches came completely under the dominance of william 's most trusted norman barons , including bernard de neufmarch , roger of montgomery in shropshire and hugh lupus in cheshire these normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of wales was at some point subject to norman interference norman words , such as baron \( barwn \) , first entered welsh at that time
the legendary religious zeal of the normans was exercised in religious wars long before the first crusade carved out a norman principality in antioch they were major foreign participants in the reconquista in iberia in 1018 , roger de tosny travelled to the iberian peninsula to carve out a state for himself from moorish lands , but failed in 1064 , during the war of barbastro , william of montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty
in 1096 , crusaders passing by the siege of amalfi were joined by bohemond of taranto and his nephew tancred with an army of italo normans bohemond was the de facto leader of the crusade during its passage through asia minor after the successful siege of antioch in 1097 , bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city tancred was instrumental in the conquest of jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the crusader kingdom in transjordan and the region of galilee citation needed
the conquest of cyprus by the anglo norman forces of the third crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island , which would be under western european domination for the following 380 years although not part of a planned operation , the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected
in april 1191 richard the lion hearted left messina with a large fleet in order to reach acre but a storm dispersed the fleet after some searching , it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc e berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus , together with the wrecks of several other ships , including the treasure ship survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island 's despot isaac komnenos on 1 may 1191 , richard 's fleet arrived in the port of limassol on cyprus he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure isaac refused , so richard landed his troops and took limassol
various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time , in particular guy de lusignan all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat the local barons abandoned isaac , who considered making peace with richard , joining him on the crusade , and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by richard but isaac changed his mind and tried to escape richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island , his troops being led by guy de lusignan isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains , because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons by 1 june , richard had conquered the whole island his exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island richard left for acre on 5 june , with his allies before his departure , he named two of his norman generals , richard de camville and robert de thornham , as governors of cyprus
while in limassol , richard the lion heart married berengaria of navarre , first born daughter of king sancho vi of navarre the wedding was held on 12 may 1191 at the chapel of st george and it was attended by richard 's sister joan , whom he had brought from sicily the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus , and berengaria queen of england and queen of cyprus as well
the rapid anglo norman conquest proved more important than it seemed the island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the holy land , whose occupation by the christians could not continue without support from the sea shortly after the conquest , cyprus was sold to the knights templar and it was subsequently acquired , in 1192 , by guy de lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom it was only in 1489 that the venetians acquired full control of the island , which remained a christian stronghold until the fall of famagusta in 1571
between 1402 and 1405 , the expedition led by the norman noble jean de bethencourt and the poitevine gadifer de la salle conquered the canarian islands of lanzarote , fuerteventura and el hierro off the atlantic coast of africa their troops were gathered in normandy , gascony and were later reinforced by castilian colonists
bethencourt took the title of king of the canary islands , as vassal to henry iii of castile in 1418 , jean 's nephew maciot de bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to enrique p rez de guzm n , 2nd count de niebla
the customary law of normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of jersey and guernsey in the channel islands norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues these are the tr s ancien coutumier \( very ancient customary \) , authored between 1200 and 1245 and the grand coutumier de normandie \( great customary of normandy , originally summa de legibus normanniae in curia la cali \) , authored between 1235 and 1245
norman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued they spread a unique romanesque idiom to england and italy , and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north french style fundamentally altered the military landscape their style was characterised by rounded arches , particularly over windows and doorways , and massive proportions
in england , the period of norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the anglo saxon and precedes the early gothic in southern italy , the normans incorporated elements of islamic , lombard , and byzantine building techniques into their own , initiating a unique style known as norman arab architecture within the kingdom of sicily
in the visual arts , the normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered however , in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform , encouraging the cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits , especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts the church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy the chief monasteries taking part in this renaissance of norman art and scholarship were mont saint michel , f camp , jumi ges , bec , saint ouen , saint evroul , and saint wandrille these centres were in contact with the so called winchester school , which channeled a pure carolingian artistic tradition to normandy in the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century , normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts , but it was brief and the major scriptoria of normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century
the french wars of religion in the 16th century and french revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this norman creativity the former , with their violence , caused the wanton destruction of many norman edifices the latter , with its assault on religion , caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type , and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging
by far the most famous work of norman art is the bayeux tapestry , which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery it was commissioned by odo , the bishop of bayeux and first earl of kent , employing natives from kent who were learned in the nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the danish vikings
in britain , norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork , such as capitals and baptismal fonts in southern italy , however , norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its greek , lombard , and arab forebears of the royal regalia preserved in palermo , the crown is byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of arab craftsmanship with arabic inscriptions many churches preserve sculptured fonts , capitals , and more importantly mosaics , which were common in norman italy and drew heavily on the greek heritage lombard salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under norman domination finally should be noted the intercourse between french crusaders traveling to the holy land who brought with them french artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern italy amongst their norman cousins for this reason many south italian churches preserve works from france alongside their native pieces
normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century f camp abbey and saint evroul abbey were centres of musical production and education at f camp , under two italian abbots , william of volpiano and john of ravenna , the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught it is still the most common form of pitch representation in english and german speaking countries today also at f camp , the staff , around which neumes were oriented , was first developed and taught in the 11th century under the german abbot isembard , la trinit du mont became a centre of musical composition
at saint evroul , a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in normandy under the norman abbot robert de grantmesnil , several monks of saint evroul fled to southern italy , where they were patronised by robert guiscard and established a latin monastery at sant'eufemia there they continued the tradition of singing
nikola tesla \( serbian cyrillic 10 july 1856 7 january 1943 \) was a serbian american inventor , electrical engineer , mechanical engineer , physicist , and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current \( ac \) electricity supply system
tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the united states in 1884 to work for thomas edison in new york city he soon struck out on his own with financial backers , setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices his patented ac induction motor and transformer were licensed by george westinghouse , who also hired tesla for a short time as a consultant his work in the formative years of electric power development was involved in a corporate alternating current direct current war of currents as well as various patent battles
tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high voltage , high frequency power experiments in new york and colorado springs , and made early \( 1893 \) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices he tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission , his unfinished wardenclyffe tower project in his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators generators , electrical discharge tubes , and early x ray imaging he also built a wireless controlled boat , one of the first ever exhibited
tesla was renowned for his achievements and showmanship , eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an archetypal mad scientist his patents earned him a considerable amount of money , much of which was used to finance his own projects with varying degrees of success 121 , 154 he lived most of his life in a series of new york hotels , through his retirement tesla died on 7 january 1943 his work fell into relative obscurity after his death , but in 1960 the general conference on weights and measures named the si unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor there has been a resurgence in popular interest in tesla since the 1990s
tesla was born on 10 july o s 28 june 1856 into a serb family in the village of smiljan , austrian empire \( modern day croatia \) his father , milutin tesla , was a serbian orthodox priest tesla 's mother , uka tesla \( n e mandi \) , whose father was also an orthodox priest , 10 had a talent for making home craft tools , mechanical appliances , and the ability to memorize serbian epic poems uka had never received a formal education nikola credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother 's genetics and influence tesla 's progenitors were from western serbia , near montenegro 12
tesla was the fourth of five children he had an older brother named dane and three sisters , milka , angelina and marica dane was killed in a horse riding accident when nikola was five in 1861 , tesla attended the lower or primary school in smiljan where he studied german , arithmetic , and religion in 1862 , the tesla family moved to gospi , austrian empire , where tesla 's father worked as a pastor nikola completed lower or primary school , followed by the lower real gymnasium or normal school
in 1870 , tesla moved to karlovac , to attend school at the higher real gymnasium , where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher martin sekuli 32 the classes were held in german , as it was a school within the austro hungarian military frontier tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head , which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating he finished a four year term in three years , graduating in 1873 33
in 1873 , tesla returned to his birthtown , smiljan shortly after he arrived , tesla contracted cholera he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times tesla 's father , in a moment of despair , promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness \( his father had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood \)
in 1874 , tesla evaded being drafted into the austro hungarian army in smiljan by running away to tomingaj , near gra ac there , he explored the mountains in hunter 's garb tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger , both physically and mentally he read many books while in tomingaj , and later said that mark twain 's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness
in 1875 , tesla enrolled at austrian polytechnic in graz , austria , on a military frontier scholarship during his first year , tesla never missed a lecture , earned the highest grades possible , passed nine exams \( nearly twice as many required \) , started a serbian culture club , and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father , which stated , your son is a star of first rank tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a m to 11 p m , no sundays or holidays excepted he was mortified when his father made light of those hard won honors after his father 's death in 1879 , tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father , warning that unless he were removed from the school , tesla would be killed through overwork during his second year , tesla came into conflict with professor poeschl over the gramme dynamo , when tesla suggested that commutators were n't necessary at the end of his second year , tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling during his third year , tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money , later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family tesla said that he conquered his passion then and there , but later he was known to play billiards in the us when exam time came , tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study , but was denied he never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester
in december 1878 , tesla left graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school his friends thought that he had drowned in the mur river tesla went to maribor \( now in slovenia \) , where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month he spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets in march 1879 , milutin tesla went to maribor to beg his son to return home , but nikola refused nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time
on 24 march 1879 , tesla was returned to gospi under police guard for not having a residence permit on 17 april 1879 , milutin tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness \( although some sources say that he died of a stroke \) during that year , tesla taught a large class of students in his old school , higher real gymnasium , in gospi
in january 1880 , two of tesla 's uncles put together enough money to help him leave gospi for prague where he was to study unfortunately , he arrived too late to enroll at charles ferdinand university he never studied greek , a required subject and he was illiterate in czech , another required subject tesla did , however , attend lectures at the university , although , as an auditor , he did not receive grades for the courses
in 1881 , tesla moved to budapest to work under ferenc pusk s at a telegraph company , the budapest telephone exchange upon arrival , tesla realized that the company , then under construction , was not functional , so he worked as a draftsman in the central telegraph office instead within a few months , the budapest telephone exchange became functional and tesla was allocated the chief electrician position during his employment , tesla made many improvements to the central station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier , which was never patented nor publicly described
in 1882 , tesla began working for the continental edison company in france , designing and making improvements to electrical equipment in june 1884 , he relocated to new york city 57 60 where he was hired by thomas edison to work at his edison machine works on manhattan 's lower east side tesla 's work for edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving more difficult problems
tesla was offered the task of completely redesigning the edison company 's direct current generators in 1885 , he said that he could redesign edison 's inefficient motor and generators , making an improvement in both service and economy according to tesla , edison remarked , there 's fifty thousand dollars in it for you if you can do it 54 57 64 this has been noted as an odd statement from an edison whose company was stingy with pay and who did not have that sort of cash on hand after months of work , tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment edison , saying that he was only joking , replied , tesla , you do n't understand our american humor 64 instead , edison offered a us 10 a week raise over tesla 's us 18 per week salary tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned
after leaving edison 's company tesla partnered with two businessmen in 1886 , robert lane and benjamin vail , who agreed to finance an electric lighting company in tesla 's name , tesla electric light manufacturing the company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators , the first patents issued to tesla in the us
the investors showed little interest in tesla 's ideas for new types of motors and electrical transmission equipment and also seemed to think it was better to develop an electrical utility than invent new systems they eventually forced tesla out leaving him penniless he even lost control of the patents he had generated since he had assigned them to the company in lieu of stock he had to work at various electrical repair jobs and even as a ditch digger for 2 per day tesla considered the winter of 1886 1887 as a time of terrible headaches and bitter tears during this time , he questioned the value of his education
in late 1886 tesla met alfred s brown , a western union superintendent , and new york attorney charles f peck the two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain based on tesla 's patents and other ideas they agreed to back him financially and handle his patents together in april 1887 they formed the tesla electric company with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go to tesla , to peck and brown , and to fund development they set up a laboratory for tesla at 89 liberty street in manhattan where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors , generators and other devices
one of the things tesla developed at that laboratory in 1887 was an induction motor that ran on alternating current , a power system format that was starting to be built in europe and the united states because of its advantages in long distance , high voltage transmission the motor used polyphase current which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor \( a principle tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882 \) this innovative electric motor , patented in may 1888 , was a simple self starting design that did not need a commutator , thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes
in 1888 , the editor of electrical world magazine , thomas commerford martin \( a friend and publicist \) , arranged for tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system , including his induction motor , at the american institute of electrical engineers \( now ieee \) engineers working for the westinghouse electric manufacturing company reported to george westinghouse that tesla had a viable ac motor and related power system something for which westinghouse had been trying to secure patents westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator less , rotating magnetic field based induction motor presented in a paper in march 1888 by the italian physicist galileo ferraris , but decided tesla 's patent would probably control the market
in july 1888 , brown and peck negotiated a licensing deal with george westinghouse for tesla 's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for 60 , 000 in cash and stock and a royalty of 2 50 per ac horsepower produced by each motor westinghouse also hired tesla for one year for the large fee of 2 , 000 \( 52 , 700 in today 's dollars \) per month to be a consultant at the westinghouse electric manufacturing company 's pittsburgh labs
during that year , tesla worked in pittsburgh , helping to create an alternating current system to power the city 's streetcars he found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other westinghouse engineers over how best to implement ac power between them , they settled on a 60 cycle ac current system tesla proposed \( to match the working frequency of tesla 's motor \) , although they soon found that , since tesla 's induction motor could only run at a constant speed , it would not work for street cars they ended up using a dc traction motor instead
tesla 's demonstration of his induction motor and westinghouse 's subsequent licensing of the patent , both in 1888 , put tesla firmly on the ac side of the so called war of currents , an electrical distribution battle being waged between thomas edison and george westinghouse that had been simmering since westinghouse 's first ac system in 1886 and had reached the point of all out warfare by 1888 this started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with edison holding all the patents for dc and the incandescent light and westinghouse using his own patented ac system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the edison patent the acquisition of a feasible ac motor gave westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated ac system , but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of tesla 's motor had to be put on hold for a while the competition resulted in edison machine works pursuing ac development in 1890 and by 1892 thomas edison was no longer in control of his own company , which was consolidated into the conglomerate general electric and converting to an ac delivery system at that point
in 1893 , george westinghouse won the bid to light the 1893 world 's columbian exposition in chicago with alternating current , beating out a general electric bid by one million dollars this world 's fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits it was a key event in the history of ac power , as westinghouse demonstrated the safety , reliability , and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system to the american public at the columbian exposition , under a banner announcing the tesla polyphase system , tesla demonstrated a series of electrical effects previously performed throughout america and europe , 76 included using high voltage , high frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas discharge lamp 79 an observer noted
in 1893 richard dean adams , who headed up the niagara falls cataract construction company sought tesla 's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to utilize power generated by the falls with many systems being proposed by several us and european companies including two phase and three phase ac , high voltage dc , and even compressed air adams pumped tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems tesla advised adams that a two phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two phase alternating current based on tesla 's advice and westinghouse 's demonstration that they could build a complete ac system at the columbian exposition , a contract for building a two phase ac generating system at the niagara falls was awarded to westinghouse electric a further contract to build the ac distribution system was awarded to general electric
the mid 1890s saw the conglomerate general electric , backed by financier j p morgan , involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with westinghouse electric although a patent sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 westinghouse was still cash strapped from the financial warfare to secure further loans , westinghouse was forced to revisit tesla 's ac patent , which bankers considered a financial strain on the company \( at that point westinghouse had paid out an estimated 200 , 000 in licenses and royalties to tesla , brown , and peck \) in 1897 , westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to tesla in stark terms , saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of westinghouse electric and tesla would have to deal with the bankers to try to collect future royalties westinghouse convinced tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over tesla 's ac patents in exchange for westinghouse electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of 216 , 000 this provided westinghouse a break from what , due to alternating current 's rapid gain in popularity , had turned out to be an overly generous 2 50 per ac horsepower royalty
on 30 july 1891 , at the age of 35 , tesla became a naturalized citizen of the united states , and established his south fifth avenue laboratory , and later another at 46 e houston street , in new york he lit electric lamps wirelessly at both locations , demonstrating the potential of wireless power transmission in the same year , he patented the tesla coil
tesla served as a vice president of the american institute of electrical engineers , the forerunner \( along with the institute of radio engineers \) of the modern day ieee , from 1892 to 1894
starting in 1894 , tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of invisible kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments \( later identified as roentgen rays or x rays \) his early experiments were with crookes tubes , a cold cathode electrical discharge tube soon after , much of tesla 's early research hundreds of invention models , plans , notes , laboratory data , tools , photographs , valued at 50 , 000 was lost in the 5th avenue laboratory fire of march 1895 tesla is quoted by the new york times as saying , i am in too much grief to talk what can i say \? tesla may have inadvertently captured an x ray image predating , by a few weeks , wilhelm r ntgen 's december 1895 announcement of the discovery of x rays when he tried to photograph mark twain illuminated by a geissler tube , an earlier type of gas discharge tube the only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens 134
in march 1896 , after hearing of wilhelm r ntgen 's discovery of x ray and x ray imaging \( radiography \) , tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in x ray imaging , developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the tesla coil \( the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation \) in his research , tesla devised several experimental setups to produce x rays tesla held that , with his circuits , the instrument will enable one to generate roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus
tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single node x ray producing devices in his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon , he attributed the skin damage to various causes he believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the roentgen rays , but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin , and to a lesser extent , by nitrous acid tesla incorrectly believed that x rays were longitudinal waves , such as those produced in waves in plasmas these plasma waves can occur in force free magnetic fields
at the beginning of 1893 westinghouse engineer benjamin lamme had made great progress developing an efficient version of tesla 's induction motor and westinghouse electric started branding their complete polyphase phase ac system as the tesla polyphase system , noting how they believed tesla 's patents gave them patent priority over other ac systems
tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end using a device he constructed known as the egg of columbus
on 11 july 1934 , the new york herald tribune published an article on tesla , in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single electrode vacuum tubes a minute particle would break off the cathode , pass out of the tube , and physically strike him tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body , and again at the place where it passed out in comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his electric gun , tesla said , the particles in the beam of force will travel much faster than such particles and they will travel in concentrations
tesla 's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far as lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in st louis , missouri , the franklin institute in philadelphia , pennsylvania , and the national electric light association tesla 's demonstrations and principles were written about widely through various media outlets many devices such as the tesla coil were used in the further development of radio
in 1898 , tesla demonstrated a radio controlled boat which he dubbed teleautomaton to the public during an electrical exhibition at madison square garden the crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat , such as magic , telepathy , and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside tesla tried to sell his idea to the u s military as a type of radio controlled torpedo , but they showed little interest remote radio control remained a novelty until world war i and afterward , when a number of countries used it in military programs tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate teleautomatics in an address to a meeting of the commercial club in chicago , while he was travelling to colorado springs , on 13 may 1899
in 1900 , tesla was granted patents for a system of transmitting electrical energy and an electrical transmitter when guglielmo marconi made his famous first ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901 , tesla quipped that it was done with 17 tesla patents , though there is little to support this claim this was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with tesla 's patents being upheld in 1903 , followed by a reverse decision in favor of marconi in 1904 in 1943 , a supreme court of the united states decision restored the prior patents of tesla , oliver lodge , and john stone the court declared that their decision had no bearing on marconi 's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission , just that since marconi 's claim to certain patents were questionable , he could not claim infringement on those same patents \( there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a world war i claim against the u s government by the marconi company via simply restoring tesla 's prior patent \)
on 17 may 1899 , tesla moved to colorado springs , where he would have room for his high voltage , high frequency experiments his lab was located near foote ave and kiowa st he chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it upon his arrival , he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments , transmitting signals from pikes peak to paris citation needed the 1978 book colorado springs notes , 1899 1900 contains descriptions of tesla 's experiments on 15 june 1899 , tesla performed his first experiments at his colorado springs lab he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long , but very thick and noisy
tesla investigated atmospheric electricity , observing lightning signals via his receivers he stated that he observed stationary waves during this time the great distances and the nature of what tesla was detecting from lightning storms confirmed his belief that the earth had a resonant frequency
he produced artificial lightning , with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in cripple creek , colorado people walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground sparks sprang from water line taps when touched light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes butterflies were electrified , swirling in circles with blue halos of st elmo 's fire around their wings
while experimenting , tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator , causing a power outage in august 1917 , tesla explained what had happened in the electrical experimenter as an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated , it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out , due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them , and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation !
during his time at his lab , tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded may be communications from another planet he mentioned them in a letter to reporter julian hawthorne at the philadelphia north american on 8 december 1899 and in a december 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the red cross society where he referred to messages from another world that read 1 2 3 reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion tesla was hearing signals from mars he expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 february 1901 collier 's weekly article talking with planets where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing intelligently controlled signals and that the signals could come from mars , venus , or other planets it has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted marconi 's european experiments in july 1899 marconi may have transmitted the letter s \( dot dot dot \) in a naval demonstration , the same three impulses that tesla hinted at hearing in colorado or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission
in 1899 , john jacob astor iv invested 100 , 000 for tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system instead , tesla used the money to fund his colorado springs experiments
on 7 january 1900 , tesla left colorado springs citation needed his lab was torn down in 1904 , and its contents were sold two years later to satisfy a debt
the colorado experiments had prepared tesla for the establishment of the trans atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as wardenclyffe near shoreham , long island
tesla later approached morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter when asked where all the money had gone , tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the panic of 1901 , which he \( morgan \) had caused morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by tesla 's breach of contract by asking for more funds tesla wrote another plea to morgan , but it was also fruitless morgan still owed tesla money on the original agreement , and tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began
in december 1901 , marconi successfully transmitted the letter s from england to newfoundland , terminating tesla 's relationship with morgan improper synthesis \? over the next five years , tesla wrote over 50 letters to morgan , pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of wardenclyffe tesla continued the project for another nine months the tower was erected to its full 187 feet \( 57 m \) in july 1903 , tesla wrote to morgan that in addition to wireless communication , wardenclyffe would be capable of wireless transmission of electric power on 14 october 1904 , morgan finally replied through his secretary , stating , it will be impossible for me to do anything in the matter , after tesla had written to morgan when the financier was meeting with the archbishop of canterbury in an attempt to appeal to his christian spirit
on his 50th birthday in 1906 , tesla demonstrated his 200 horsepower \( 150 kilowatts \) 16 , 000 rpm bladeless turbine during 1910 1911 at the waterside power station in new york , several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100 5 , 000 hp
tesla invented a steam powered mechanical oscillator tesla 's oscillator while experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his houston street lab , tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings as the speed grew , it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and , belatedly realizing the danger , he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment , just as the police arrived 162 164 in february 1912 , an article nikola tesla , dreamer by allan l benson was published in world today , in which an artist 's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption , tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth 's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization a continuation of this process would , he says , eventually split the earth in two
tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence in 1912 , he crafted a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity , wiring the walls of a schoolroom and , saturating the schoolroom with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency the whole room will thus , mr tesla claims , be converted into a health giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath ' the plan was , at least provisionally approved by then superintendent of new york city schools , william h maxwell
before world war i , tesla sought overseas investors after the war started , tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in european countries eventually , he sold wardenclyffe for 20 , 000 \( 472 , 500 in today 's dollars \) in 1917 , around the time that the wardenclyffe tower was demolished by boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset , tesla received aiee 's highest honor , the edison medal
in the august 1917 edition of the magazine electrical experimenter tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an electric ray of tremendous frequency , with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen \( a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar \) tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water but mile girardeau , who helped develop france 's first radar system in the 1930s , noted in 1953 that tesla 's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating \( tesla \) was prophesying or dreaming , since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out , but one must add that if he was dreaming , at least he was dreaming correctly 266
on 6 november 1915 , a reuters news agency report from london had the 1915 nobel prize in physics awarded to thomas edison and nikola tesla however , on 15 november , a reuters story from stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to sir william henry bragg and william lawrence bragg for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of x rays 245 there were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that tesla and or edison had refused the prize 245 the nobel foundation said , any rumor that a person has not been given a nobel prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous a recipient could only decline a nobel prize after he is announced a winner 245
there have been subsequent claims by tesla biographers that edison and tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other that each sought to minimize the other 's achievements and right to win the award that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first that both rejected any possibility of sharing it and even that a wealthy edison refused it to keep tesla from getting the 20 , 000 prize money 245
in the years after these rumors , neither tesla nor edison won the prize \( although edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937 \)
in 1928 , tesla received his last patent , u s patent 1 , 655 , 114 , for a biplane capable of taking off vertically \( vtol aircraft \) and then be gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane tesla thought the plane would sell for less than 1 , 000 251 although the aircraft was probably impractical , it may be the earliest known design for what became the tiltrotor tilt wing concept as well as the earliest proposal for the use of turbine engines in rotor aircraft improper synthesis \?
starting in 1934 , the westinghouse electric manufacturing company began paying tesla 125 per month as well as paying his rent at the hotel new yorker , expenses the company would pay for the rest of tesla 's life accounts on how this came about vary several sources say westinghouse was worried about potential bad publicity surrounding the impoverished conditions their former star inventor was living under it has been described as being couched in the form of a consulting fee to get around tesla 's aversion to accept charity , or by one biographer \( marc seifer \) , as a type of unspecified settlement
in 1935 , in an annual birthday celebration interview , tesla announced a method of transmitting mechanical energy with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance , a related new means of communication , and a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits
in the fall of 1937 , after midnight one night , tesla left the hotel new yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons while crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel , tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground tesla 's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident \( the full extent of his injuries will never be known tesla refused to consult a doctor an almost lifelong custom \) tesla did n't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid , only asking to be taken to his hotel via cab tesla was bedridden for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window soon , they failed to come in early 1938 , tesla was able to get up he at once resumed the pigeon feeding walks on a much more limited scale , but frequently had a messenger act for him
later in life , tesla made claims concerning a teleforce weapon after studying the van de graaff generator the press variably referred to it as a peace ray or death ray tesla described the weapon as capable of being used against ground based infantry or for anti aircraft purposes
in 1937 , at a luncheon in his honor concerning the death ray , tesla stated , but it is not an experiment i have built , demonstrated and used it only a little time will pass before i can give it to the world his records indicate that the device is based on a narrow stream of small tungsten pellets that are accelerated via high voltage \( by means akin to his magnifying transformer \)
during the same year , tesla wrote a treatise , the art of projecting concentrated non dispersive energy through the natural media , concerning charged particle beam weapons tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a superweapon that would put an end to all war this treatise is currently in the nikola tesla museum archive in belgrade it describes an open ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit , a method of charging particles to millions of volts , and a method of creating and directing non dispersive particle streams \( through electrostatic repulsion \) tesla tried to interest the us war department , the united kingdom , the soviet union , and yugoslavia in the device
during the period in which the negotiations were being conducted , tesla said that efforts had been made to steal the invention his room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized , but the thieves , or spies , left empty handed he said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen , for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper the blueprint for the teleforce weapon was all in his mind
on 7 january 1943 , at the age of 86 , tesla died alone in room 3327 of the new yorker hotel his body was later found by maid alice monaghan after she had entered tesla 's room , ignoring the do not disturb sign that tesla had placed on his door two days earlier assistant medical examiner h w wembly examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis tesla 's remains were taken to the frank e campbell funeral home at madison ave and 81st st a long time friend and supporter of tesla , hugo gernsback , commissioned a sculptor to create a death mask , now displayed in the nikola tesla museum
two days later , the fbi ordered the alien property custodian to seize tesla 's belongings , even though tesla was an american citizen tesla 's entire estate from the hotel new yorker and other new york city hotels was transported to the manhattan storage and warehouse company under the office of alien property \( oap \) seal john g trump , a professor at m i t and a well known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the national defense research committee , was called in to analyze the tesla items in oap custody after a three day investigation , trump 's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands , stating
on 10 january 1943 , new york city mayor fiorello la guardia read a eulogy written by slovene american author louis adamic live over the wnyc radio while violin pieces ave maria and tamo daleko were played in the background on 12 january , two thousand people attended a state funeral for tesla at the cathedral of saint john the divine after the funeral , tesla 's body was taken to the ferncliff cemetery in ardsley , new york , where it was later cremated the following day , a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the trinity chapel \( today 's serbian orthodox cathedral of saint sava \) in new york city
in 1952 , following pressure from tesla 's nephew , sava kosanovi , tesla 's entire estate was shipped to belgrade in 80 trunks marked n t in 1957 , kosanovi 's secretary charlotte muzar transported tesla 's ashes from the united states to belgrade the ashes are displayed in a gold plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the nikola tesla museum
tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions some of tesla 's patents are not accounted for , and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives there are a minimum of 278 patents issued to tesla in 26 countries that have been accounted for many of tesla 's patents were in the united states , britain , and canada , but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe 62 many inventions developed by tesla were not put into patent protection
tesla worked every day from 9 00 a m until 6 00 p m or later , with dinner from exactly 8 10 p m , at delmonico 's restaurant and later the waldorf astoria hotel tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter , who also could be the only one to serve him the meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock he dined alone , except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations tesla would then resume his work , often until 3 00 a m 283 , 286
for exercise , tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day he squished his toes one hundred times for each foot every night , saying that it stimulated his brain cells
in an interview with newspaper editor arthur brisbane , tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy , stating , suppose i made up my mind to murder you , he said , in a second you would know it now , is n't that wonderful \? by what process does the mind get at all this \? in the same interview , tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one
near the end of his life , tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons and even brought injured ones into his hotel room to nurse back to health he said that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily tesla spent over 2 , 000 , including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal , to fix her broken wing and leg tesla stated ,
tesla was 6 feet 2 inches \( 1 88 m \) tall and weighed 142 pounds \( 64 kg \) , with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926 292 he was an elegant , stylish figure in new york city , meticulous in his grooming , clothing , and regimented in his daily activities
tesla read many works , memorizing complete books , and supposedly possessed a photographic memory 33 he was a polyglot , speaking eight languages serbo croatian , czech , english , french , german , hungarian , italian , and latin 282 tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration during his early life , tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness he suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes , often accompanied by visions 33 often , the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered just by hearing the name of an item , he would be able to envision it in realistic detail 33 tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision , including all dimensions , before moving to the construction stage , a technique sometimes known as picture thinking he typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory beginning in his childhood , tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life 33
during his second year of study at graz , tesla developed a passion for \( and became very proficient at \) billiards , chess and card playing , sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table 43 , 301 on one occasion at his laboratory , tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest 208 kenneth swezey , a journalist whom tesla had befriended , confirmed that tesla rarely slept swezey recalled one morning when tesla called him at 3 a m i was sleeping in my room like one dead suddenly , the telephone ring awakened me tesla spoke animatedly , with pauses , as he work ed out a problem , comparing one theory to another , commenting and when he felt he had arrived at the solution , he suddenly closed the telephone
tesla never married he said his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities 33 however , toward the end of his life , he told a reporter , sometimes i feel that by not marrying , i made too great a sacrifice to my work there have been numerous accounts of women vying for tesla 's affection , even some madly in love with him citation needed tesla , though polite and soft spoken , did not have any known relationships
tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work however , when he did engage in a social life , many people spoke very positively and admiringly of tesla robert underwood johnson described him as attaining a distinguished sweetness , sincerity , modesty , refinement , generosity , and force his loyal secretary , dorothy skerrit , wrote his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul tesla 's friend , julian hawthorne , wrote , seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet , a philosopher , an appreciator of fine music , a linguist , and a connoisseur of food and drink 80
tesla was a good friend of francis marion crawford , robert underwood johnson , stanford white , fritz lowenstein , george scherff , and kenneth swezey in middle age , tesla became a close friend of mark twain they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere twain notably described tesla 's induction motor invention as the most valuable patent since the telephone in the late 1920s , tesla also befriended george sylvester viereck , a poet , writer , mystic , and later , a nazi propagandist tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by viereck and his wife
tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people , such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight 110 he was quick to criticize clothing on several occasions , tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress 33
tesla exhibited a pre atomic understanding of physics in his writings he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles , stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge \( he believed that if electrons existed at all , they were some fourth state of matter or sub atom that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity \) 249 tesla believed that atoms are immutable they could not change state or be split in any way he was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy
tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy 247 he was also critical of einstein 's theory of relativity , saying
tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892 , and in 1937 , at age 81 , claimed in a letter to have completed a dynamic theory of gravity that would put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions , as that of curved space he stated that the theory was worked out in all details and that he hoped to soon give it to the world further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings 309
tesla , like many of his era , became a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics his opinion stemmed from the belief that humans' pity had interfered with the natural ruthless workings of nature , rather than from conceptions of a master race or inherent superiority of one person over another his advocacy of it was , however , to push it further in a 1937 interview , he stated
in 1926 , tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality , and indicated that humanity 's future would be run by queen bees he believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future
tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post world war i environment in a printed article , science and discovery are the great forces which will lead to the consummation of the war \( 20 december 1914 \) tesla believed that the league of nations was not a remedy for the times and issues citation needed
tesla was raised an orthodox christian later in his life , he did not consider himself to be a believer in the orthodox sense , and opposed religious fanaticism despite this , he had a profound respect for both buddhism and christianity
however , his religious views remain uncertain due to other statements that he made for example , in his article , a machine to end war , published in 1937 , tesla stated
tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals among his books are my inventions the autobiography of nikola tesla , compiled and edited by ben johnston the fantastic inventions of nikola tesla , compiled and edited by david hatcher childress and the tesla papers
many of tesla 's writings are freely available on the web , including the article the problem of increasing human energy , published in the century magazine in 1900 , and the article experiments with alternate currents of high potential and high frequency , published in his book inventions , researches and writings of nikola tesla
tesla 's legacy has endured in books , films , radio , tv , music , live theater , comics and video games the impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction
on tesla 's 75th birthday in 1931 , time magazine put him on its cover the cover caption all the world 's his power house noted his contribution to electrical power generation he received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering , including albert einstein
computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer , which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps , such as an algorithm
a problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources , whatever the algorithm used the theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them , such as time and storage other complexity measures are also used , such as the amount of communication \( used in communication complexity \) , the number of gates in a circuit \( used in circuit complexity \) and the number of processors \( used in parallel computing \) one of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do
closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem more precisely , it tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources in turn , imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory the latter theory asks what kind of problems can , in principle , be solved algorithmically
a computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance the input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself in computational complexity theory , a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved in contrast , an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance , which can serve as the input for a decision problem for example , consider the problem of primality testing the instance is a number \( e g 15 \) and the solution is yes if the number is prime and no otherwise \( in this case no \) stated another way , the instance is a particular input to the problem , and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input
to further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance , consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of germany 's 15 largest cities \? the quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem , such as asking for a round trip through all sites in milan whose total length is at most 10 km for this reason , complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances
when considering computational problems , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet \( i e , the set 0 , 1 \) , and thus the strings are bitstrings as in a real world computer , mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded for example , integers can be represented in binary notation , and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices , or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary
decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory a decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0 a decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes , and the non members are those instances whose output is no the objective is to decide , with the aid of an algorithm , whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration if the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes , the algorithm is said to accept the input string , otherwise it is said to reject the input
an example of a decision problem is the following the input is an arbitrary graph the problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected , or not the formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs of course , to obtain a precise definition of this language , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings
a function problem is a computational problem where a single output \( of a total function \) is expected for every input , but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem , that is , it is n't just yes or no notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem
it is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems however , this is not really the case , since function problems can be recast as decision problems for example , the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples \( a , b , c \) such that the relation a b c holds deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers
to measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem , one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem however , the running time may , in general , depend on the instance in particular , larger instances will require more time to solve thus the time required to solve a problem \( or the space required , or any measure of complexity \) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance this is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size for instance , in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected , how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices \?
if the input size is n , the time taken can be expressed as a function of n since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst case time complexity t \( n \) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n if t \( n \) is a polynomial in n , then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm cobham 's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm
a turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine it is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology , but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper it is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm , there exists a turing machine that solves the problem indeed , this is the statement of the church turing thesis furthermore , it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today , such as a ram machine , conway 's game of life , cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a turing machine since turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically , and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation , the turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory
a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine , which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions a probabilistic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an extra supply of random bits the ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms a non deterministic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an added feature of non determinism , which allows a turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state one way to view non determinism is that the turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step , and if it solves the problem in any of these branches , it is said to have solved the problem clearly , this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model , it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes for examples , see non deterministic algorithm
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic turing machines , probabilistic turing machines , non deterministic turing machines , quantum turing machines , symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines they are all equally powerful in principle , but when resources \( such as time or space \) are bounded , some of these may be more powerful than others
many machine models different from the standard multi tape turing machines have been proposed in the literature , for example random access machines perhaps surprisingly , each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power the time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary what all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically
however , some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources for example , a non deterministic turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once the non deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems
for a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space , a computational model such as the deterministic turing machine is used the time required by a deterministic turing machine m on input x is the total number of state transitions , or steps , the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer \( yes or no \) a turing machine m is said to operate within time f \( n \) , if the time required by m on each input of length n is at most f \( n \) a decision problem a can be solved in time f \( n \) if there exists a turing machine operating in time f \( n \) that solves the problem since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty , one defines sets of problems based on some criteria for instance , the set of problems solvable within time f \( n \) on a deterministic turing machine is then denoted by dtime \( f \( n \) \)
analogous definitions can be made for space requirements although time and space are the most well known complexity resources , any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource complexity measures are very generally defined by the blum complexity axioms other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity , circuit complexity , and decision tree complexity
the best , worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity \( or any other complexity measure \) of different inputs of the same size since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others , we define the following complexities
for example , consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort this solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input the worst case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order , and the algorithm takes time o \( n2 \) for this case if we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely , the average time taken for sorting is o \( n log n \) the best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half , also needing o \( n log n \) time
to classify the computation time \( or similar resources , such as space consumption \) , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem the complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst case complexity , unless specified otherwise analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms to show an upper bound t \( n \) on the time complexity of a problem , one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most t \( n \) however , proving lower bounds is much more difficult , since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem the phrase all possible algorithms includes not just the algorithms known today , but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future to show a lower bound of t \( n \) for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than t \( n \)
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms this makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used for instance , if t \( n \) 7n2 15n 40 , in big o notation one would write t \( n \) o \( n2 \)
of course , some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework thus , a typical complexity class has a definition like the following
but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f \( n \) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model for instance , the language xx x is any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multi tape turing machine , but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single tape turing machines if we allow polynomial variations in running time , cobham edmonds thesis states that the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related \( goldreich 2008 , chapter 1 2 \) this forms the basis for the complexity class p , which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic turing machine within polynomial time the corresponding set of function problems is fp
many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following
other important complexity classes include bpp , zpp and rp , which are defined using probabilistic turing machines ac and nc , which are defined using boolean circuits and bqp and qma , which are defined using quantum turing machines p is an important complexity class of counting problems \( not decision problems \) classes like ip and am are defined using interactive proof systems all is the class of all decision problems
for the complexity classes defined in this way , it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on \( say \) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems in particular , although dtime \( n \) is contained in dtime \( n2 \) , it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict for time and space requirements , the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively they are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other having deduced such proper set inclusions , we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved
the time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes for instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace
many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction a reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem it captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem for instance , if a problem x can be solved using an algorithm for y , x is no more difficult than y , and we say that x reduces to y there are many different types of reductions , based on the method of reduction , such as cook reductions , karp reductions and levin reductions , and the bound on the complexity of reductions , such as polynomial time reductions or log space reductions
the most commonly used reduction is a polynomial time reduction this means that the reduction process takes polynomial time for example , the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers this means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication , since squaring can be reduced to multiplication
this motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class a problem x is hard for a class of problems c if every problem in c can be reduced to x thus no problem in c is harder than x , since an algorithm for x allows us to solve any problem in c of course , the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used for complexity classes larger than p , polynomial time reductions are commonly used in particular , the set of problems that are hard for np is the set of np hard problems
if a problem x is in c and hard for c , then x is said to be complete for c this means that x is the hardest problem in c \( since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that x is one of the hardest problems in c \) thus the class of np complete problems contains the most difficult problems in np , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in p because the problem p np is not solved , being able to reduce a known np complete problem , 2 , to another problem , 1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial time solution for 1 this is because a polynomial time solution to 1 would yield a polynomial time solution to 2 similarly , because all np problems can be reduced to the set , finding an np complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that p np
the complexity class p is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm this hypothesis is called the cobham edmonds thesis the complexity class np , on the other hand , contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently , but for which no efficient algorithm is known , such as the boolean satisfiability problem , the hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem since deterministic turing machines are special non deterministic turing machines , it is easily observed that each problem in p is also member of the class np
the question of whether p equals np is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution if the answer is yes , many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions these include various types of integer programming problems in operations research , many problems in logistics , protein structure prediction in biology , and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems the p versus np problem is one of the millennium prize problems proposed by the clay mathematics institute there is a us 1 , 000 , 000 prize for resolving the problem
it was shown by ladner that if p np then there exist problems in np that are neither in p nor np complete such problems are called np intermediate problems the graph isomorphism problem , the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be np intermediate they are some of the very few np problems not known to be in p or to be np complete
the graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic an important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in p , np complete , or np intermediate the answer is not known , but it is believed that the problem is at least not np complete if graph isomorphism is np complete , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level , it is believed that graph isomorphism is not np complete the best algorithm for this problem , due to laszlo babai and eugene luks has run time 2o \( \( n log \( n \) \) \) for graphs with n vertices
the integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer phrased as a decision problem , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems , such as the rsa algorithm the integer factorization problem is in np and in co np \( and even in up and co up \) if the problem is np complete , the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level \( i e , np will equal co np \) the best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve , which takes time o \( e \( 64 9 \) 1 3 \( n log 2 \) 1 3 \( log \( n log 2 \) \) 2 3 \) to factor an n bit integer however , the best known quantum algorithm for this problem , shor 's algorithm , does run in polynomial time unfortunately , this fact does n't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non quantum complexity classes
many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal , but this has not been proved for instance p np pp pspace , but it is possible that p pspace if p is not equal to np , then p is not equal to pspace either since there are many known complexity classes between p and pspace , such as rp , bpp , pp , bqp , ma , ph , etc , it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory
along the same lines , co np is the class containing the complement problems \( i e problems with the yes no answers reversed \) of np problems it is believed that np is not equal to co np however , it has not yet been proven it has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then p is not equal to np
similarly , it is not known if l \( the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space \) is strictly contained in p or equal to p again , there are many complexity classes between the two , such as nl and nc , and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes
problems that can be solved in theory \( e g , given large but finite time \) , but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful , are known as intractable problems in complexity theory , problems that lack polynomial time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs in fact , the cobham edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are exptime hard if np is not the same as p , then the np complete problems are also intractable in this sense to see why exponential time algorithms might be unusable in practice , consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting for small n , say 100 , and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second , the program would run for about 4 1010 years , which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe even with a much faster computer , the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress nevertheless , a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical if its running time is , say , n15 , it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances
what intractability means in practice is open to debate saying that a problem is not in p does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are for example , the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases similarly , algorithms can solve the np complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and sat solvers routinely handle large instances of the np complete boolean satisfiability problem
before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off , numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers most influential among these was the definition of turing machines by alan turing in 1936 , which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer
as fortnow homer \( 2003 \) point out , the beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal paper on the computational complexity of algorithms by juris hartmanis and richard stearns \( 1965 \) , which laid out the definitions of time and space complexity and proved the hierarchy theorems also , in 1965 edmonds defined a good algorithm as one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size
earlier papers studying problems solvable by turing machines with specific bounded resources include john myhill 's definition of linear bounded automata \( myhill 1960 \) , raymond smullyan 's study of rudimentary sets \( 1961 \) , as well as hisao yamada 's paper on real time computations \( 1962 \) somewhat earlier , boris trakhtenbrot \( 1956 \) , a pioneer in the field from the ussr , studied another specific complexity measure as he remembers
even though some proofs of complexity theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding , one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding this can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently
in 1967 , manuel blum developed an axiomatic complexity theory based on his axioms and proved an important result , the so called , speed up theorem the field really began to flourish in 1971 when the us researcher stephen cook and , working independently , leonid levin in the ussr , proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are np complete in 1972 , richard karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper , reducibility among combinatorial problems , in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems , each infamous for its computational intractability , are np complete
the role of teacher is often formal and ongoing , carried out at a school or other place of formal education in many countries , a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college these professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy , the science of teaching teachers , like other professionals , may have to continue their education after they qualify , a process known as continuing professional development teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning , providing a course of study which is called the curriculum
a teacher 's role may vary among cultures teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy , craftsmanship or vocational training , the arts , religion , civics , community roles , or life skills
in some countries , formal education can take place through home schooling informal learning may be assisted by a teacher occupying a transient or ongoing role , such as a family member , or by anyone with knowledge or skills in the wider community setting
religious and spiritual teachers , such as gurus , mullahs , rabbis , pastors youth pastors and lamas , may teach religious texts such as the quran , torah or bible
teaching may be carried out informally , within the family , which is called homeschooling , or in the wider community formal teaching may be carried out by paid professionals such professionals enjoy a status in some societies on a par with physicians , lawyers , engineers , and accountants \( chartered or cpa \)
a teacher 's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips , supervise study halls , help with the organization of school functions , and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities in some education systems , teachers may have responsibility for student discipline
there are a variety of bodies designed to instill , preserve and update the knowledge and professional standing of teachers around the world many governments operate teacher 's colleges , which are generally established to serve and protect the public interest through certifying , governing and enforcing the standards of practice for the teaching profession
the functions of the teacher 's colleges may include setting out clear standards of practice , providing for the ongoing education of teachers , investigating complaints involving members , conducting hearings into allegations of professional misconduct and taking appropriate disciplinary action and accrediting teacher education programs in many situations teachers in publicly funded schools must be members in good standing with the college , and private schools may also require their teachers to be college peoples in other areas these roles may belong to the state board of education , the superintendent of public instruction , the state education agency or other governmental bodies in still other areas teaching unions may be responsible for some or all of these duties
in education , teachers facilitate student learning , often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors a teacher who teaches on an individual basis may be described as a tutor
the objective is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to learning , including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills , knowledge and or thinking skills different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy when deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students' background knowledge , environment , and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority many times , teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips the increasing use of technology , specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade , has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom
the objective is typically a course of study , lesson plan , or a practical skill a teacher may follow standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority the teacher may interact with students of different ages , from infants to adults , students with different abilities and students with learning disabilities
teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom pedagogy can be thought of in two manners first , teaching itself can be taught in many different ways , hence , using a pedagogy of teaching styles second , the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly for example , an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows the real bulk of learning takes place in self study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop the function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy , inspire the bored , deflate the cocky , encourage the timid , detect and correct individual flaws , and broaden the viewpoint of all this function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game
perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children in primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum in secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers the relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor , specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day
this is true throughout most of the united states as well however , alternative approaches for primary education do exist one of these , sometimes referred to as a platoon system , involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject the advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes
co teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions co teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom co teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential co teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning
throughout the history of education the most common form of school discipline was corporal punishment while a child was in school , a teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent , with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them
in past times , corporal punishment \( spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain \) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world most western countries , and some others , have now banned it , but it remains lawful in the united states following a us supreme court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the us constitution
30 us states have banned corporal punishment , the others \( mostly in the south \) have not it is still used to a significant \( though declining \) degree in some public schools in alabama , arkansas , georgia , louisiana , mississippi , oklahoma , tennessee and texas private schools in these and most other states may also use it corporal punishment in american schools is administered to the seat of the student 's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle this often used to take place in the classroom or hallway , but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal 's office
official corporal punishment , often by caning , remains commonplace in schools in some asian , african and caribbean countries for details of individual countries see school corporal punishment
currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the united states , the uk , ireland , singapore and other countries it requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day \( such as lunch , recess or after school \) or even to attend school on a non school day , e g saturday detention held at some schools during detention , students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work , write lines or a punishment essay , or sit quietly
a modern example of school discipline in north america and western europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm , clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior teachers are expected to respect their students sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline verification needed
whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics , some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline citation needed such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently this viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries in east asia for instance that combine strict discipline with high standards of education citation needed
it 's not clear , however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of east asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in western countries in japan , for example , although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in western countries , classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic although , officially , schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior , in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all
where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students , maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction , leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught in response , teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students , ignoring attention seeking and disruptive students the result of this is that motivated students , facing demanding university entrance examinations , receive disproportionate resources given the emphasis on attainment of university places , administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate
sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike they also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole , thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation , rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good , clear laws , fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community , and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws , is a school in which community discipline prevails , and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops , against other schools today , where rules are arbitrary , authority is absolute , punishment is capricious , and due process of law is unknown
since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials , it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials on teacher course evaluations , it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students these teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis one of the difficulties in this approach is that teachers may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject which in turn bores the students as well students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who did n't show much enthusiasm for the course materials
teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged , interested , energetic , and curious about learning the subject matter recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom controlled , experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm , such as demonstrative gesturing , dramatic movements which are varied , and emotional facial expressions , result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom
there are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self determined in their own learning process the concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher 's enthusiasm may contribute to the student 's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning also , enthusiasm may act as a motivational embellishment increasing a student 's interest by the variety , novelty , and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher 's presentation of the material finally , the concept of emotional contagion , may also apply students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher citation needed
research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student teacher relationships enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students useful teacher to student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement here , personal success is a student 's internal goal of improving himself , whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior a teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals students who receive this positive influence show stronger self confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions
students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making , allow humor into their classroom , and demonstrate a willingness to play
the way a teacher promotes the course they are teaching , the more the student will get out of the subject matter the three most important aspects of teacher enthusiasm are enthusiasm about teaching , enthusiasm about the students , and enthusiasm about the subject matter a teacher must enjoy teaching if they do not enjoy what they are doing , the students will be able to tell they also must enjoy being around their students a teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future the teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching for example , a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students a spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well an enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life
misconduct by teachers , especially sexual misconduct , has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts a study by the american association of university women reported that 9 6 of students in the united states claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education be they a volunteer , bus driver , teacher , administrator or other adult sometime during their educational career
a study in england showed a 0 3 prevalence of sexual abuse by any professional , a group that included priests , religious leaders , and case workers as well as teachers it is important to note , however , that the british study referenced above is the only one of its kind and consisted of a random probability sample of 2 , 869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer assisted study and that the questions referred to sexual abuse with a professional , not necessarily a teacher it is therefore logical to conclude that information on the percentage of abuses by teachers in the united kingdom is not explicitly available and therefore not necessarily reliable the aauw study , however , posed questions about fourteen types of sexual harassment and various degrees of frequency and included only abuses by teachers the sample was drawn from a list of 80 , 000 schools to create a stratified two stage sample design of 2 , 065 8th to 11th grade students its reliability was gauged at 95 with a 4 margin of error
in the united states especially , several high profile cases such as debra lafave , pamela rogers , and mary kay letourneau have caused increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct
chris keates , the general secretary of national association of schoolmasters union of women teachers , said that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register and that prosecution for statutory rape is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about this has led to outrage from child protection and parental rights groups fears of being labelled a pedophile or hebephile has led to several men who enjoy teaching avoiding the profession this has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers
teachers face several occupational hazards in their line of work , including occupational stress , which can negatively impact teachers' mental and physical health , productivity , and students' performance stress can be caused by organizational change , relationships with students , fellow teachers , and administrative personnel , working environment , expectations to substitute , long hours with a heavy workload , and inspections teachers are also at high risk for occupational burnout
a 2000 study found that 42 of uk teachers experienced occupational stress , twice the figure for the average profession a 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety , depression , and stress than average workers
there are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching organizational interventions , like changing teachers' schedules , providing support networks and mentoring , changing the work environment , and offering promotions and bonuses , may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers individual level interventions , including stress management training and counseling , are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers
there are many similarities and differences among teachers around the world in almost all countries teachers are educated in a university or college governments may require certification by a recognized body before they can teach in a school in many countries , elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school the high school student follows an education specialty track , obtain the prerequisite student teaching time , and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation in addition to certification , many educational institutions especially within the us , require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom this is not always the case with adult further learning institutions but is fast becoming the norm in many countries as security concerns grow

education in wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the united kingdom for example , a significant number of students all over wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of welsh in 2008 09 , 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries , schools , colleges and universities and in adult education lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16
teachers in wales can be registered members of trade unions such as atl , nut or nasuwt and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of teachers in wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years a growing cause of concern are that attacks on teachers in welsh schools which reached an all time high between 2005 and 2010
in the united states , each state determines the requirements for getting a license to teach in public schools teaching certification generally lasts three years , but teachers can receive certificates that last as long as ten years public school teachers are required to have a bachelor 's degree and the majority must be certified by the state in which they teach many charter schools do not require that their teachers be certified , provided they meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by no child left behind additionally , the requirements for substitute temporary teachers are generally not as rigorous as those for full time professionals the bureau of labor statistics estimates that there are 1 4 million elementary school teachers , 674 , 000 middle school teachers , and 1 million secondary school teachers employed in the u s
in the past , teachers have been paid relatively low salaries however , average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years us teachers are generally paid on graduated scales , with income depending on experience teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor 's degree and certificate salaries vary greatly depending on state , relative cost of living , and grade taught salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts the median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was 46 , 000 in 2004 , with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor 's degree being an estimated 32 , 000 median salaries for preschool teachers , however , were less than half the national median for secondary teachers , clock in at an estimated 21 , 000 in 2004 for high school teachers , median salaries in 2007 ranged from 35 , 000 in south dakota to 71 , 000 in new york , with a national median of 52 , 000 some contracts may include long term disability insurance , life insurance , emergency personal leave and investment options the american federation of teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006 07 school year found that the average teacher salary was 51 , 009 in a salary survey report for k 12 teachers , elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning 39 , 259 high school teachers had the highest median salary earning 41 , 855 many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after school programs and other extracurricular activities in addition to monetary compensation , public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits \( like health insurance \) compared to other occupations merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers , paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations , high test scores and for high success at their overall school also , with the advent of the internet , many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income , most notably on teacherspayteachers com
there are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in christianity , across all three major traditions \( roman \) catholic , \( eastern \) orthodox catholic , and protestant non denominational , with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian hierarchical christian traditions with a long tradition of discernment of spirits , of vocations , and other aspects of spiritual life , especially the roman and orthodox catholic churches these positions include the honoured but informal position of starets or elder a man \( or , less often , woman \) , often a monastic , considered to be graced by god with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest \( spiritual pride or deception \) who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the orthodox catholic tradition , especially russian orthodoxy \( see optina monastery , which had a long line of said starets \) the priest or confessor in roman catholicism , who is often a man in holy orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen \( even the pope of rome has a confessor , who is not always a bishop , and , due to the hierarchical structure of the roman church , can not be his equal in authority \) , which is often a semi official to official position , as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the orthodox catholic and protestant traditions and the almost exclusively informal arrangements \( generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline \) of mentorship \( both of adults and children , in the latter case often a youth pastor \) in the protestant and non denominational traditions , which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically roman confessor position in some of the more historic and conservative reformation churches , such as some of the lutheran and anglican in keeping with the individualistic nature of most protestant denominations , the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small , with a heavy emphasis placed on heavy reading and personal , spirit enlightened interpretation of the holy bible
in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints \( lds church \) , the teacher is an office in the aaronic priesthood , generally conferred on young boys or recent converts , and has little in common with the spiritual teacher archetype the role of spiritual teacher may be filled by many individuals in the lds church , often a trusted friend , who may hold any office , from elder to bishop , or no office at all the emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the lds church is similar to that in the more low church traditions of protestantism , with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family , ideally in consultation with his wife , even if the husband is not a member of the lds church , based on interpretatios of certain biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage even priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home further , additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of patriarch , which is supposed by latter day saints to grant certain gifts of the spirit , such as the ability to prophesy , to its holders this guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing
in hinduism the spiritual teacher is known as a guru , and , in many traditions of hinduism especially those common in the west the emphasis on spiritual mentorship is extremely high , with gurus often exercising a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples
in tibetan buddhism the teachers of dharma in tibet are most commonly called a lama a lama who has through phowa and siddhi consciously determined to be reborn , often many times , in order to continue their bodhisattva vow is called a tulku
there are many concepts of teachers in islam , ranging from mullahs \( the teachers at madrassas \) to ulemas , who teach of the laws of islam for the proper way of islamic living according to the sunnah and ahadith , and can render legal verdicts upon matters of islamic law in accordance with the teaching of one of the four schools of jurisprudence in the more spiritual or mystical islamic tradition of sufism , the position of spiritual teacher and an esoteric \( as opposed to exoteric , or actions oriented , e g the five pillars of islam \) spirituality and spiritual knowledge takes on a more important dimension , with emphasis on learning from living saints the highest of which is a qutb and of traditions passed down from initiate to initiate , and traceable back to the founder of the order
martin luther \( lu r or lu r german ma ti n l t \( listen \) 10 november 1483 18 february 1546 \) was a german professor of theology , composer , priest , former monk and a seminal figure in the protestant reformation luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the late medieval catholic church he strongly disputed the claim that freedom from god 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money he proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his ninety five theses of 1517 his refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of pope leo x in 1520 and the holy roman emperor charles v at the diet of worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the emperor
luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of god 's grace through faith in jesus christ as redeemer from sin his theology challenged the authority and office of the pope by teaching that the bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from god and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized christians to be a holy priesthood those who identify with these , and all of luther 's wider teachings , are called lutherans even though luther insisted on christian or evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed christ
his translation of the bible into the vernacular \( instead of latin \) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and german culture it fostered the development of a standard version of the german language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an english translation , the tyndale bible his hymns influenced the development of singing in churches his marriage to katharina von bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing protestant clergy to marry
martin luther was born to hans luder \( or ludher , later luther \) and his wife margarethe \( n e lindemann \) on 10 november 1483 in eisleben , saxony , then part of the holy roman empire he was baptized as a catholic the next morning on the feast day of st martin of tours his family moved to mansfeld in 1484 , where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council the religious scholar martin marty describes luther 's mother as a hard working woman of trading class stock and middling means and notes that luther 's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant he had several brothers and sisters , and is known to have been close to one of them , jacob hans luther was ambitious for himself and his family , and he was determined to see martin , his eldest son , become a lawyer he sent martin to latin schools in mansfeld , then magdeburg in 1497 , where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the brethren of the common life , and eisenach in 1498 the three schools focused on the so called trivium grammar , rhetoric , and logic luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell
in 1501 , at the age of 19 , he entered the university of erfurt , which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse he was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises he received his master 's degree in 1505
in accordance with his father 's wishes , luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately , believing that law represented uncertainty luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy , expressing particular interest in aristotle , william of ockham , and gabriel biel he was deeply influenced by two tutors , bartholomaeus arnoldi von usingen and jodocus trutfetter , who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience philosophy proved to be unsatisfying , offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving god , which to luther was more important reason could not lead men to god , he felt , and he thereafter developed a love hate relationship with aristotle over the latter 's emphasis on reason for luther , reason could be used to question men and institutions , but not god human beings could learn about god only through divine revelation , he believed , and scripture therefore became increasingly important to him
he later attributed his decision to an event on 2 july 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home during a thunderstorm , a lightning bolt struck near him later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , help ! saint anna , i will become a monk ! he came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break he left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed augustinian cloister in erfurt on 17 july 1505 one friend blamed the decision on luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends luther himself seemed saddened by the move those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the black cloister this day you see me , and then , not ever again , he said his father was furious over what he saw as a waste of luther 's education
luther dedicated himself to the augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair he said , i lost touch with christ the savior and comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul johann von staupitz , his superior , pointed luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of christ he taught that true repentance does not involve self inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart
in 1507 , he was ordained to the priesthood , and in 1508 , von staupitz , first dean of the newly founded university of wittenberg , sent for luther , to teach theology he received a bachelor 's degree in biblical studies on 9 march 1508 , and another bachelor 's degree in the sentences by peter lombard in 1509
on 19 october 1512 , he was awarded his doctor of theology and , on 21 october 1512 , was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the university of wittenberg , having been called to the position of doctor in bible he spent the rest of his career in this position at the university of wittenberg
in 1516 , johann tetzel , a dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences , was sent to germany by the roman catholic church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild st peter 's basilica in rome roman catholic theology stated that faith alone , whether fiduciary or dogmatic , cannot justify man justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works \( fides caritate formata \) the benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church
on 31 october 1517 , luther wrote to his bishop , albert of mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences he enclosed in his letter a copy of his disputation of martin luther on the power and efficacy of indulgences , which came to be known as the ninety five theses hans hillerbrand writes that luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly searching , rather than doctrinaire hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in thesis 86 , which asks why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest crassus , build the basilica of st peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money \?
luther objected to a saying attributed to johann tetzel that as soon as the coin in the coffer rings , the soul from purgatory \( also attested as 'into heaven' \) springs
he insisted that , since forgiveness was god 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error christians , he said , must not slacken in following christ on account of such false assurances
however , this oft quoted saying of tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary catholic teaching on indulgences , but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate yet if tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead , his teaching on indulgences for the living was in line with catholic dogma of the time
according to scholars walter kr mer , g tz trenkler , gerhard ritter , and gerhard prause , the story of the posting on the door , even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history , has little foundation in truth the story is based on comments made by philipp melanchthon , though it is thought that he was not in wittenberg at the time
it was not until january 1518 that friends of luther translated the 95 theses from latin into german and printed and widely copied them , making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press within two weeks , copies of the theses had spread throughout germany within two months , they had spread throughout europe
luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching france , england , and italy as early as 1519 students thronged to wittenberg to hear luther speak he published a short commentary on galatians and his work on the psalms this early part of luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive three of his best known works were published in 1520 to the christian nobility of the german nation , on the babylonian captivity of the church , and on the freedom of a christian
from 1510 to 1520 , luther lectured on the psalms , the books of hebrews , romans , and galatians as he studied these portions of the bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the catholic church in new ways he became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of christianity the most important for luther was the doctrine of justification god 's act of declaring a sinner righteous by faith alone through god 's grace he began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of god 's grace , attainable only through faith in jesus as the messiah this one and firm rock , which we call the doctrine of justification , he wrote , is the chief article of the whole christian doctrine , which comprehends the understanding of all godliness
luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of god this teaching by luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication on the bondage of the will , which was written in response to on free will by desiderius erasmus \( 1524 \) luther based his position on predestination on st paul 's epistle to the ephesians 2 8 10 against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with god , luther wrote that christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves that righteousness not only comes from christ but actually is the righteousness of christ , imputed to christians \( rather than infused into them \) through faith that is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law , he wrote faith is that which brings the holy spirit through the merits of christ faith , for luther , was a gift from god the experience of being justified by faith was as though i had been born again his entry into paradise , no less , was a discovery about the righteousness of god a discovery that the just person of whom the bible speaks \( as in romans 1 17 \) lives by faith he explained his concept of justification in the smalcald articles
luther 's rediscovery of christ and his salvation was the first of two points that became the foundation for the reformation his railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it
archbishop albrecht of mainz and magdeburg did not reply to luther 's letter containing the 95 theses he had the theses checked for heresy and in december 1517 forwarded them to rome he needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric as luther later noted , the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of st peter 's church in rome
pope leo x was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , with great care as is proper over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti papal theology first , the dominican theologian sylvester mazzolini drafted a heresy case against luther , whom leo then summoned to rome the elector frederick persuaded the pope to have luther examined at augsburg , where the imperial diet was held there , in october 1518 , under questioning by papal legate cardinal cajetan luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical church because historistical interpretation of bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the antichrist the prophecies concerning the antichrist soon became the center of controversy the hearings degenerated into a shouting match more than his writing the 95 theses , luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to cajetan
in january 1519 , at altenburg in saxony , the papal nuncio karl von miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach luther made certain concessions to the saxon , who was a relative of the elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did the theologian johann eck , however , was determined to expose luther 's doctrine in a public forum in june and july 1519 , he staged a disputation with luther 's colleague andreas karlstadt at leipzig and invited luther to speak luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that matthew 16 18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible for this , eck branded luther a new jan hus , referring to the czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 from that moment , he devoted himself to luther 's defeat
on 15 june 1520 , the pope warned luther with the papal bull \( edict \) exsurge domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 theses , within 60 days that autumn , johann eck proclaimed the bull in meissen and other towns karl von miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but luther , who had sent the pope a copy of on the freedom of a christian in october , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at wittenberg on 10 december 1520 , an act he defended in why the pope and his recent book are burned and assertions concerning all articles as a consequence , luther was excommunicated by pope leo x on 3 january 1521 , in the bull decet romanum pontificem
the enforcement of the ban on the 95 theses fell to the secular authorities on 18 april 1521 , luther appeared as ordered before the diet of worms this was a general assembly of the estates of the holy roman empire that took place in worms , a town on the rhine it was conducted from 28 january to 25 may 1521 , with emperor charles v presiding prince frederick iii , elector of saxony , obtained a safe conduct for luther to and from the meeting
johann eck , speaking on behalf of the empire as assistant of the archbishop of trier , presented luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question he prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day
at the end of this speech , luther raised his arm in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout michael mullett considers this speech as a world classic of epoch making oratory
luther refused to recant his writings he is sometimes also quoted as saying here i stand i can do no other recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable , since they were inserted before may god help me only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings however , mullett suggests that given his nature , we are free to believe that luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words
over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine luther 's fate the emperor presented the final draft of the edict of worms on 25 may 1521 , declaring luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest we want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic it also made it a crime for anyone in germany to give luther food or shelter it permitted anyone to kill luther without legal consequence
luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to wittenberg was planned frederick iii had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen they escorted luther to the security of the wartburg castle at eisenach during his stay at wartburg , which he referred to as my patmos , luther translated the new testament from greek into german and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings these included a renewed attack on archbishop albrecht of mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a refutation of the argument of latomus , in which he expounded the principle of justification to jacobus latomus , an orthodox theologian from louvain
in this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract god 's favor is a sin all humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and god 's grace \( which cannot be earned \) alone can make them just on 1 august 1521 , luther wrote to melanchthon on the same theme be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in christ be stronger , and rejoice in christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world we will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides
in the summer of 1521 , luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of church practices in on the abrogation of the private mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation his essay on confession , whether the pope has the power to require it rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since every christian is a confessor in november , luther wrote the judgement of martin luther on monastic vows he assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation
in 1521 luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the reformation placing them on prophetic faith his main interest was centered on the prophecy of the little horn in daniel 8 9 12 , 23 25 the antichrist of 2 thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the papacy so too was the little horn of daniel 7 , coming up among the divisions of rome , explicitly applied
luther made his pronouncements from wartburg in the context of rapid developments at wittenberg , of which he was kept fully informed andreas karlstadt , supported by the ex augustinian gabriel zwilling , embarked on a radical programme of reform there in june 1521 , exceeding anything envisaged by luther the reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy after secretly visiting wittenberg in early december 1521 , luther wrote a sincere admonition by martin luther to all christians to guard against insurrection and rebellion wittenberg became even more volatile after christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so called zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and christ 's imminent return when the town council asked luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act
luther secretly returned to wittenberg on 6 march 1522 he wrote to the elector during my absence , satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which i cannot repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word for eight days in lent , beginning on invocavit sunday , 9 march , luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the invocavit sermons in these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust god 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change
the effect of luther 's intervention was immediate after the sixth sermon , the wittenberg jurist jerome schurf wrote to the elector oh , what joy has dr martin 's return spread among us ! his words , through divine mercy , are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth
luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices by working alongside the authorities to restore public order , he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the reformation after banishing the zwickau prophets , he now faced a battle against not only the established church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence
despite his victory in wittenberg , luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield preachers such as zwickau prophet nicholas storch and thomas m ntzer helped instigate the german peasants' war of 1524 25 , during which many atrocities were committed , often in luther 's name there had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century luther 's pamphlets against the church and the hierarchy , often worded with liberal phraseology , now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general revolts broke out in franconia , swabia , and thuringia in 1524 , even drawing support from disaffected nobles , many of whom were in debt gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as m ntzer in thuringia and michael gaismair in tyrol , the revolts turned into war
luther sympathised with some of the peasants' grievances , as he showed in his response to the twelve articles in may 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities during a tour of thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops' palaces , and libraries in against the murderous , thieving hordes of peasants , written on his return to wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs
luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds first , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring christ 's counsel to render unto caesar the things that are caesar 's st paul had written in his epistle to the romans 13 1 7 that all authorities are appointed by god and therefore should not be resisted this reference from the bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the divine right of kings , or , in the german case , the divine right of the princes second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants outside the law of god and empire , so they deserved death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers lastly , luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves christian brethren and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the gospel
without luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons others felt betrayed their defeat by the swabian league at the battle of frankenhausen on 15 may 1525 , followed by m ntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the reformation to a close thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while luther 's reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers
martin luther married katharina von bora , one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the nimbschen cistercian convent in april 1523 , when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels suddenly , and while i was occupied with far different thoughts , he wrote to wenceslaus link , the lord has plunged me into marriage at the time of their marriage , katharina was 26 years old and luther was 41 years old
on 13 june 1525 , the couple was engaged with johannes bugenhagen , justus jonas , johannes apel , philipp melanchthon and lucas cranach the elder and his wife as witnesses on the evening of the same day , the couple was married by bugenhagen the ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out , and were made up two weeks later on 27 june
some priests and former religious had already married , including andreas karlstadt and justus jonas , but luther 's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage he had long condemned vows of celibacy on biblical grounds , but his decision to marry surprised many , not least melanchthon , who called it reckless luther had written to george spalatin on 30 november 1524 , i shall never take a wife , as i feel at present not that i am insensible to my flesh or sex \( for i am neither wood nor stone \) but my mind is averse to wedlock because i daily expect the death of a heretic before marrying , luther had been living on the plainest food , and , as he admitted himself , his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time
luther and his wife moved into a former monastery , the black cloister , a wedding present from the new elector john the steadfast \( 1525 32 \) they embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage , though money was often short between bearing six children , hans june 1526 elizabeth 10 december 1527 , who died within a few months magdalene 1529 , who died in luther 's arms in 1542 martin 1531 paul january 1533 and margaret 1534 katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders luther confided to michael stiefel on 11 august 1526 my katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that i would not exchange my poverty for the riches of croesus
by 1526 , luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church his biblical ideal of congregations' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable according to bainton luther 's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality if he were forced to choose , he would take his stand with the masses , and this was the direction in which he moved from 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into system
to avoid confusing or upsetting the people , luther avoided extreme change he also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another he concentrated on the church in the electorate of saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his saxon model he worked closely with the new elector , john the steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with rome for luther 's biographer martin brecht , this partnership was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign the elector authorised a visitation of the church , a power formerly exercised by bishops at times , luther 's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements for example , the instructions for the visitors of parish pastors in electoral saxony \( 1528 \) , drafted by melanchthon with luther 's approval , stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins , despite luther 's position that faith alone ensures justification the eisleben reformer johannes agricola challenged this compromise , and luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works the instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in luther 's thought and practice
in response to demands for a german liturgy , luther wrote a german mass , which he published in early 1526 he did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the latin mass but as an alternative for the simple people , a public stimulation for people to believe and become christians luther based his order on the catholic service but omitted everything that smacks of sacrifice and the mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread he retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony some reformers , including followers of huldrych zwingli , considered luther 's service too papistic and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the catholic mass luther 's service , however , included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in german , as well as of parts of the liturgy , including luther 's unison setting of the creed to reach the simple people and the young , luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism he also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services
luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the electorate of saxony , which began in 1527 they also assessed the standard of pastoral care and christian education in the territory merciful god , what misery i have seen , luther wrote , the common people knowing nothing at all of christian doctrine and unfortunately many pastors are well nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching
luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of christianity to the congregations in 1529 , he wrote the large catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the small catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves the catechisms provided easy to understand instructional and devotional material on the ten commandments , the apostles' creed , the lord 's prayer , baptism , and the lord 's supper luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of christian faith would not just be learned by rote , the way monkeys do it , but understood
the catechism is one of luther 's most personal works regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , he wrote , i am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a saturnian hunger , i would rather see them all devoured for i acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the bondage of the will and the catechism the small catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching it remains in use today , along with luther 's hymns and his translation of the bible
luther 's small catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children likewise the larger catechism was effective for pastors using the german vernacular , they expressed the apostles' creed in simpler , more personal , trinitarian language he rewrote each article of the creed to express the character of the father , the son , or the holy spirit luther 's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the trinity , each of which works in the catechumen 's life that is , luther depicted the trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known the father creates , the son redeems , and the spirit sanctifies , a divine unity with separate personalities salvation originates with the father and draws the believer to the father luther 's treatment of the apostles' creed must be understood in the context of the decalogue \( the ten commandments \) and the lord 's prayer , which are also part of the lutheran catechical teaching
luther had published his german translation of the new testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the old testament in 1534 , when the whole bible was published he continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life others had translated the bible into german , but luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine when he was criticised for inserting the word alone after faith in romans 3 28 , he replied in part t he text itself and the meaning of st paul urgently require and demand it for in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of christian doctrine , namely , that we are justified by faith in christ without any works of the law but when works are so completely cut away and that must mean that faith alone justifies whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'faith alone justifies us , and not works'
luther 's translation used the variant of german spoken at the saxon chancellery , intelligible to both northern and southern germans he intended his vigorous , direct language to make the bible accessible to everyday germans , for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance
published at a time of rising demand for german language publications , luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential bible translation as such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the german language and literature furnished with notes and prefaces by luther , and with woodcuts by lucas cranach that contained anti papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of luther 's doctrine throughout germany the luther bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as william tyndale 's english bible \( 1525 forward \) , a precursor of the king james bible
luther was a prolific hymn writer , authoring hymns such as ein feste burg ist unser gott \( a mighty fortress is our god \) , based on psalm 46 , and vom himmel hoch , da komm ich her \( from heaven above to earth i come \) , based on luke 2 11 12 luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children his tool of choice for this connection was the singing of german hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena he often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of germany in the 20th century
luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding reformation this behavior started with his learning of the execution of johann esch and heinrich voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the roman catholic church for lutheran views , prompting luther to write the hymn ein neues lied wir heben an \( a new song we raise \) , which is generally known in english by john c messenger 's translation by the title and first line flung to the heedless winds and sung to the tune ibstone composed in 1875 by maria c tiddeman
luther 's 1524 creedal hymn wir glauben all an einen gott \( we all believe in one true god \) is a three stanza confession of faith prefiguring luther 's 1529 three part explanation of the apostles' creed in the small catechism luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier german creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular lutheran liturgies as early as 1525 sixteenth century lutheran hymnals also included wir glauben all among the catechetical hymns , although 18th century hymnals tended to label the hymn as trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th century lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune
luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the lord 's prayer , vater unser im himmelreich , corresponds exactly to luther 's explanation of the prayer in the small catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas the hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the lord 's prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions the extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune other 16th and 20th century versifications of the lord 's prayer have adopted luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter
luther wrote aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir \( from depths of woe i cry to you \) in 1523 as a hymnic version of psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm hymns for use in german worship in a collaboration with paul speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the achtliederbuch , the first lutheran hymnal in 1524 luther developed his original four stanza psalm paraphrase into a five stanza reformation hymn that developed the theme of grace alone more fully because it expressed essential reformation doctrine , this expanded version of aus tiefer not was designated as a regular component of several regional lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including luther 's own along with erhart hegenwalt 's hymnic version of psalm 51 , luther 's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of luther 's catechism , concerning confession
luther wrote ach gott , vom himmel sieh darein \( oh god , look down from heaven \) nun komm , der heiden heiland \( now come , savior of the gentiles \) , based on veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn \( hauptlied \) for advent he transformed a solus ortus cardine to christum wir sollen loben schon \( we should now praise christ \) and veni creator spiritus to komm , gott sch pfer , heiliger geist \( come , holy spirit , lord god \) he wrote two hymns on the ten commandments , dies sind die heilgen zehn gebot and mensch , willst du leben seliglich his gelobet seist du , jesu christ \( praise be to you , jesus christ \) became the main hymn for christmas he wrote for pentecost nun bitten wir den heiligen geist , and adopted for easter christ ist erstanden \( christ is risen \) , based on victimae paschali laudes mit fried und freud ich fahr dahin , a paraphrase of nunc dimittis , was intended for purification , but became also a funeral hymn he paraphrased the te deum as herr gott , dich loben wir with a simplified form of the melody it became known as the german te deum
luther 's 1541 hymn christ unser herr zum jordan kam \( to jordan came the christ our lord \) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the small catechism luther adopted a preexisting johann walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of psalm 67 's prayer for grace wolf heintz 's four part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the lutheran reformation in halle in 1541 preachers and composers of the 18th century , including j s bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late 19th century lutheran pietism
luther 's hymns were included in early lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the reformation he supplied four of eight songs of the first lutheran hymnal achtliederbuch , 18 of 26 songs of the erfurt enchiridion , and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by johann walter , eyn geystlich gesangk buchleyn , all published in 1524
luther 's hymns inspired composers to write music johann sebastian bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely christ lag in todes banden , bwv 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle \( 1724 to 1725 \) ach gott , vom himmel sieh darein , bwv 2 , christ unser herr zum jordan kam , bwv 7 , nun komm , der heiden heiland , bwv 62 , gelobet seist du , jesu christ , bwv 91 , and aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir , bwv 38 , later ein feste burg ist unser gott , bwv 80 , and in 1735 w r gott nicht mit uns diese zeit , bwv 14
in contrast to the views of john calvin and philipp melanchthon , throughout his life luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and lazarus this also led luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints it is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace he also rejected the existence of purgatory , which involved christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death he affirmed the continuity of one 's personal identity beyond death in his smalcald articles , he described the saints as currently residing in their graves and in heaven
the lutheran theologian franz pieper observed that luther 's teaching about the state of the christian 's soul after death differed from the later lutheran theologians such as johann gerhard lessing \( 1755 \) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of lutheran orthodoxy on this issue
luther 's commentary on genesis contains a passage which concludes that the soul does not sleep \( anima non sic dormit \) , but wakes \( sed vigilat \) and experiences visions francis blackburne in 1765 argued that john jortin misread this and other passages from luther , while gottfried fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man in this life \( homo enim in hac vita \) tired from his daily labour \( defatigus diurno labore \) who at night enters his bedchamber \( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum \) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams
in october 1529 , philip i , landgrave of hesse , convoked an assembly of german and swiss theologians at the marburg colloquy , to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging protestant states agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the eucharist the sacrament of the lord 's supper an issue crucial to luther
the theologians , including zwingli , melanchthon , martin bucer , and johannes oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by jesus at the last supper this is my body which is for you and this cup is the new covenant in my blood \( 1 corinthians 11 23 26 \) luther insisted on the real presence of the body and blood of christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed god to be only spiritually or symbolically present zwingli , for example , denied jesus' ability to be in more than one place at a time but luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature according to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational citing jesus' words the flesh profiteth nothing \( john 6 63 \) , zwingli said , this passage breaks your neck do n't be too proud , luther retorted , german necks do n't break that easily this is hesse , not switzerland on his table luther wrote the words hoc est corpus meum \( this is my body \) in chalk , to continually indicate his firm stance
despite the disagreements on the eucharist , the marburg colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the augsburg confession , and for the formation of the schmalkaldic league the following year by leading protestant nobles such as john of saxony , philip of hesse , and george , margrave of brandenburg ansbach the swiss cities , however , did not sign these agreements
some scholars have asserted that luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason he wrote , all the articles of our christian faith , which god has revealed to us in his word , are in presence of reason sheerly impossible , absurd , and false and that reason in no way contributes to faith for reason is the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things however , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute contemporary lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in luther luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to bernhard lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work fides und ratio that luther ultimately sought to put the two together more recently , hans peter grosshans has demonstrated that luther 's work on biblical criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method this means that for luther it is more important that the bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence the right tool for understanding the world outside of the bible for luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation here a different picture is presented of a luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres
in 1523 , luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ however , as the reformation continued , luther began to lose hope in large scale jewish conversion to christianity in his later years , luther grew more hostile toward the jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists , zwinglianism , and the papacy his 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren l gen \( on the jews and their lies \) took its place among other anti jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century europe in it , he takes a hardline against judaism , writing that synagogues and jewish homes should be destroyed , their money confiscated , and liberty curtailed these statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status
at the time of the marburg colloquy , suleiman the magnificent was besieging vienna with a vast ottoman army luther had argued against resisting the turks in his 1518 explanation of the ninety five theses , provoking accusations of defeatism he saw the turks as a scourge sent to punish christians by god , as agents of the biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom luther believed to be the papacy , and the roman church he consistently rejected the idea of a holy war , as though our people were an army of christians against the turks , who were enemies of christ this is absolutely contrary to christ 's doctrine and name on the other hand , in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms , luther did support non religious war against the turks in 1526 , he argued in whether soldiers can be in a state of grace that national defence is reason for a just war by 1529 , in on war against the turk , he was actively urging emperor charles v and the german people to fight a secular war against the turks he made clear , however , that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate , to be waged through prayer and repentance around the time of the siege of vienna , luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the turks , asking god to give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies
in 1542 , luther read a latin translation of the qur'an he went on to produce several critical pamphlets on islam , which he called mohammedanism or the turk though luther saw the muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice let the turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false christians live he opposed banning the publication of the qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny
early in 1537 , johannes agricola \( 1494 1566 \) serving at the time as pastor in luther 's birthplace , eisleben preached a sermon in which he claimed that god 's gospel , not god 's moral law \( the ten commandments \) , revealed god 's wrath to christians based on this sermon and others by agricola , luther suspected that agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in wittenberg these theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to christians but belonged only to city hall luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against agricola and the antinomians , four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540 he also responded to these assertions in other writings , such as his 1539 open letter to c g ttel against the antinomians , and his book on the councils and the church from the same year
in his theses and disputations against the antinomians , luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the second use of the law , that is , the law as the holy spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is christ 's life , christ 's death for sin , or god 's goodness experienced in creation simply refusing to preach the ten commandments among christians thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l a w from the church does not eliminate the accusing law claiming that the law in any form should not be preached to christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people
on the other hand , luther also points out that the ten commandments when considered not as god 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law also positively teach how the christian ought to live this has traditionally been called the third use of the law for luther , also christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the ten commandments , which a christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis
the ten commandments , and the beginnings of the renewed life of christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism , are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future angel like life in heaven in the midst of this life luther 's teaching of the ten commandments , therefore , has clear eschatological overtones , which , characteristically for luther , do not encourage world flight but direct the christian to service to the neighbor in the common , daily vocations of this perishing world
from december 1539 , luther became implicated in the bigamy of philip i , landgrave of hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies in waiting philip solicited the approval of luther , melanchthon , and bucer , citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs the theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling , and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined , he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter as a result , on 4 march 1540 , philip married a second wife , margarethe von der saale , with melanchthon and bucer among the witnesses however , philip was unable to keep the marriage secret , and he threatened to make luther 's advice public luther told him to tell a good , strong lie and deny the marriage completely , which philip did during the subsequent public controversy in the view of luther 's biographer martin brecht , giving confessional advice for philip of hesse was one of the worst mistakes luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds luther accountable brecht argues that luther 's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice , but that he miscalculated the political implications the affair caused lasting damage to luther 's reputation
luther wrote about the jews throughout his career , though only a few of his works dealt with them directly luther rarely encountered jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled jews some ninety years earlier he considered the jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of jesus , whereas christians believed jesus was the messiah but luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against god were equally guilty as early as 1516 , he wrote that many people are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the jews dogs , evildoers , or whatever they like , while they too , and equally , do not realize who or what they are in the sight of god in 1523 , luther advised kindness toward the jews in that jesus christ was born a jew and also aimed to convert them to christianity when his efforts at conversion failed , he grew increasingly bitter toward them in his 2010 book bonhoeffer pastor , martyr , prophet , spy , christian author eric metaxas claimed that luther 's attitude towards jews unraveled along with his health
luther 's other major works on the jews were his 60 , 000 word treatise von den juden und ihren l gen \( on the jews and their lies \) , and vom schem hamphoras und vom geschlecht christi \( on the holy name and the lineage of christ \) , both published in 1543 , three years before his death luther argued that the jews were no longer the chosen people but the devil 's people , and referred to them with violent , vile language citing deuteronomy 13 , wherein moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to god , luther called for a scharfe barmherzigkeit \( sharp mercy \) against the jews to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames luther advocated setting synagogues on fire , destroying jewish prayerbooks , forbidding rabbis from preaching , seizing jews' property and money , and smashing up their homes , so that these envenomed worms would be forced into labour or expelled for all time in robert michael 's view , luther 's words we are at fault in not slaying them amounted to a sanction for murder god 's anger with them is so intense , luther concluded , that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse , while sharp mercy will reform them but little therefore , in any case , away with them !
luther spoke out against the jews in saxony , brandenburg , and silesia josel of rosheim , the jewish spokesman who tried to help the jews of saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on that priest whose name was martin luther may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the jews was doomed to perdition josel asked the city of strasbourg to forbid the sale of luther 's anti jewish works they refused initially , but did so when a lutheran pastor in hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder jews luther 's influence persisted after his death throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of jews from several german lutheran states
luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within germany he acquired the status of a prophet according to the prevailing view among historians , his anti jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an ideal underpinning for the nazis' attacks on jews reinhold lewin writes that anybody who wrote against the jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to luther according to michael , just about every anti jewish book printed in the third reich contained references to and quotations from luther heinrich himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the jews in 1940 the city of nuremberg presented a first edition of on the jews and their lies to julius streicher , editor of the nazi newspaper der st rmer , on his birthday in 1937 the newspaper described it as the most radically anti semitic tract ever published it was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54 page explanation of the aryan law by dr e h schulz and dr r frercks
on 17 december 1941 , seven protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing jews to wear the yellow badge , since after his bitter experience luther had already suggested preventive measures against the jews and their expulsion from german territory according to daniel goldhagen , bishop martin sasse , a leading protestant churchman , published a compendium of luther 's writings shortly after kristallnacht , for which diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church in the university of oxford argued that luther 's writing was a blueprint sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day , writing in the introduction , on 10 november 1938 , on luther 's birthday , the synagogues are burning in germany the german people , he urged , ought to heed these words of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the jews
at the heart of scholars' debate about luther 's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the nazis some scholars see luther 's influence as limited , and the nazis' use of his work as opportunistic biographer martin brecht points out that there is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the jews , cloaking it with the authority of the reformer johannes wallmann argues that luther 's writings against the jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between luther 's thought and nazi ideology uwe siemon netto agreed , arguing that it was because the nazis were already anti semites that they revived luther 's work hans j hillerbrand agreed that to focus on luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in german history similarly , roland bainton , noted church historian and luther biographer , wrote one could wish that luther had died before ever on the jews and their lies was written his position was entirely religious and in no respect racial
other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti judaic that is , opposed to judaism and its adherence rather than the jews as an ethnic group their violence lent a new element to the standard christian suspicion of judaism ronald berger writes that luther is credited with germanizing the christian critique of judaism and establishing anti semitism as a key element of german culture and national identity paul rose argues that he caused a hysterical and demonizing mentality about jews to enter german thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent christopher j probst in his book demonizing the jews luther and the protestant church in nazi germany \( 2012 \) , shows that a large number of german lutheran clergy and theologians during the nazi third reich used luther 's hostile publications towards the jews and their jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti semitic policies of the national socialists
some scholars , such as mark u edwards in his book luther 's last battles politics and polemics 1531 46 \( 1983 \) , suggest that since luther 's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated , it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind edwards also comments that luther often deliberately used vulgarity and violence for effect , both in his writings condemning the jews and in diatribes against turks \( muslims \) and catholics
since the 1980s , lutheran church denominations have repudiated martin luther 's statements against the jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against lutherans strommen et al 's 1970 survey of 4 , 745 north american lutherans aged 15 65 found that , compared to the other minority groups under consideration , lutherans were the least prejudiced toward jews nevertheless , professor richard \( dick \) geary , former professor of modern history at the university of nottingham , england , and the author of hitler and nazism \( routledge 1993 \) , wrote in the journal history today an article on who voted for the nazis in elections held from 1928 1933 , where he claimed that from his research he found that the nazis gained disproportionately more votes from protestant than catholic areas of germany
luther had been suffering from ill health for years , including m ni re 's disease , vertigo , fainting , tinnitus , and a cataract in one eye from 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further the years of struggle with rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the philip of hesse incident , in which luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed in 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum in december 1544 , he began to feel the effects of angina
his poor physical health made him short tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments his wife katharina was overheard saying , dear husband , you are too rude , and he responded , they are teaching me to be rude in 1545 and 1546 luther preached three times in the market church in halle , staying with his friend justus jonas during christmas
his last sermon was delivered at eisleben , his place of birth , on 15 february 1546 , three days before his death it was entirely devoted to the obdurate jews , whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all german territory , according to l on poliakov james mackinnon writes that it concluded with a fiery summons to drive the jews bag and baggage from their midst , unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became christians luther said , we want to practice christian love toward them and pray that they convert , but also that they are our public enemies and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so and so often they do
luther 's final journey , to mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings' families continuing in their father hans luther 's copper mining trade their livelihood was threatened by count albrecht of mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control the controversy that ensued involved all four mansfeld counts albrecht , philip , john george , and gerhard luther journeyed to mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion
the negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 february 1546 after 8 a m , he experienced chest pains when he went to his bed , he prayed , into your hand i commit my spirit you have redeemed me , o lord , faithful god \( ps 31 5 \) , the common prayer of the dying at 1 a m he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels he thanked god for revealing his son to him in whom he had believed his companions , justus jonas and michael coelius , shouted loudly , reverend father , are you ready to die trusting in your lord jesus christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name \? a distinct yes was luther 's reply
an apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech , and he died shortly afterwards at 2 45 a m on 18 february 1546 , aged 62 , in eisleben , the city of his birth he was buried in the castle church in wittenberg , beneath the pulpit the funeral was held by his friends johannes bugenhagen and philipp melanchthon a year later , troops of luther 's adversary charles v , holy roman emperor entered the town , but were ordered by charles not to disturb the grave
a piece of paper was later found on which luther had written his last statement the statement was in latin , apart from we are beggars , which was in german
in the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of protestantism in contrast to images of frail catholic saints , luther was presented as a stout man with a double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck he was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular german princes with whom he would join forces to spread lutheranism his large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders famous images from this period include the woodcuts by hans brosamer \( 1530 \) and lucas cranach the elder and lucas cranach the younger \( 1546 \)
luther is honoured on 18 february with a commemoration in the lutheran calendar of saints and in the episcopal \( united states \) calendar of saints in the church of england 's calendar of saints he is commemorated on 31 october
southern california , often abbreviated socal , is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises california 's southernmost 10 counties the region is traditionally described as eight counties , based on demographics and economic ties imperial , los angeles , orange , riverside , san bernardino , san diego , santa barbara , and ventura the more extensive 10 county definition , including kern and san luis obispo counties , is also used based on historical political divisions southern california is a major economic center for the state of california and the united states
the 8 and 10 county definitions are not used for the greater southern california megaregion , one of the 11 megaregions of the united states the megaregion 's area is more expansive , extending east into las vegas , nevada , and south across the mexican border into tijuana
southern california includes the heavily built up urban area stretching along the pacific coast from ventura , through the greater los angeles area and the inland empire , and down to greater san diego southern california 's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas , or msas the los angeles metropolitan area , consisting of los angeles and orange counties the inland empire , consisting of riverside and san bernardino counties the san diego metropolitan area the oxnard thousand oaks ventura metropolitan area the santa barbara metro area the san luis obispo metropolitan area and the el centro area out of these , three are heavy populated areas the los angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants , the riverside san bernardino area with over four million inhabitants , and the san diego area with over 3 million inhabitants for csa metropolitan purposes , the five counties of los angeles , orange , riverside , san bernardino , and ventura are all combined to make up the greater los angeles area with over 17 5 million people with over 22 million people , southern california contains roughly 60 percent of california 's population
to the east is the colorado desert and the colorado river at the border with arizona , and the mojave desert at the border with the state of nevada to the south is the mexico united states border
within southern california are two major cities , los angeles and san diego , as well as three of the country 's largest metropolitan areas with a population of 3 , 792 , 621 , los angeles is the most populous city in california and the second most populous in the united states to the south and with a population of 1 , 307 , 402 is san diego , the second most populous city in the state and the eighth most populous in the nation
its counties of los angeles , orange , san diego , san bernardino , and riverside are the five most populous in the state and all are in the top 15 most populous counties in the united states
the motion picture , television , and music industry is centered on the los angeles in southern california hollywood , a district within los angeles , is also a name associated with the motion picture industry headquartered in southern california are the walt disney company \( which also owns abc \) , sony pictures , universal , mgm , paramount pictures , 20th century fox , and warner brothers universal , warner brothers , and sony also run major record companies as well

many locals and tourists frequent the southern california coast for its popular beaches , and the desert city of palm springs is popular for its resort feel and nearby open spaces
southern california is not a formal geographic designation , and definitions of what constitutes southern california vary geographically , california 's north south midway point lies at exactly 37 9' 58 23 latitude , around 11 miles \( 18 km \) south of san jose however , this does not coincide with popular use of the term when the state is divided into two areas \( northern and southern california \) , the term southern california usually refers to the ten southern most counties of the state this definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35 47 28 north latitude , which form the northern borders of san luis obispo , kern , and san bernardino counties another definition for southern california uses point conception and the tehachapi mountains as the northern boundary
though there is no official definition for the northern boundary of southern california , such a division has existed from the time when mexico ruled california , and political disputes raged between the californios of monterey in the upper part and los angeles in the lower part of alta california following the acquisition of california by the united states , the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro slavery politicians to arrange the division of alta california at 36 degrees , 30 minutes , the line of the missouri compromise instead , the passing of the compromise of 1850 enabled california to be admitted to the union as a free state , preventing southern california from becoming its own separate slave state
subsequently , californios \( dissatisfied with inequitable taxes and land laws \) and pro slavery southerners in the lightly populated cow counties of southern california attempted three times in the 1850s to achieve a separate statehood or territorial status separate from northern california the last attempt , the pico act of 1859 , was passed by the california state legislature and signed by the state governor john b weller it was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 75 of voters in the proposed territory of colorado this territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger tulare county \( that included what is now kings , most of kern , and part of inyo counties \) and san luis obispo county the proposal was sent to washington , d c with a strong advocate in senator milton latham however , the secession crisis following the election of abraham lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote
in 1900 , the los angeles times defined southern california as including the seven counties of los angeles , san bernardino , orange , riverside , san diego , ventura and santa barbara in 1999 , the times added a newer county imperial to that list
the state is most commonly divided and promoted by its regional tourism groups as consisting of northern , central , and southern california regions the two aaa auto clubs of the state , the california state automobile association and the automobile club of southern california , choose to simplify matters by dividing the state along the lines where their jurisdictions for membership apply , as either northern or southern california , in contrast to the three region point of view another influence is the geographical phrase south of the tehachapis , which would split the southern region off at the crest of that transverse range , but in that definition , the desert portions of north los angeles county and eastern kern and san bernardino counties would be included in the southern california region due to their remoteness from the central valley and interior desert landscape
southern california consists of a heavily developed urban environment , home to some of the largest urban areas in the state , along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped it is the third most populated megalopolis in the united states , after the great lakes megalopolis and the northeastern megalopolis much of southern california is famous for its large , spread out , suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways the dominant areas are los angeles , orange county , san diego , and riverside san bernardino , each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area , composed of numerous smaller cities and communities the urban area is also host to an international metropolitan region in the form of san diego tijuana , created by the urban area spilling over into baja california
traveling south on interstate 5 , the main gap to continued urbanization is camp pendleton the cities and communities along interstate 15 and interstate 215 are so inter related that temecula and murrieta have as much connection with the san diego metropolitan area as they do with the inland empire to the east , the united states census bureau considers the san bernardino and riverside county areas , riverside san bernardino area as a separate metropolitan area from los angeles county while many commute to l a and orange counties , there are some differences in development , as most of san bernardino and riverside counties \( the non desert portions \) were developed in the 1980s and 1990s newly developed exurbs formed in the antelope valley north of los angeles , the victor valley and the coachella valley with the imperial valley also , population growth was high in the bakersfield kern county , santa maria and san luis obispo areas
southern california contains a mediterranean climate , with infrequent rain and many sunny days summers are hot and dry , while winters are a bit warm or mild and wet serious rain can occur unusually in the summers , temperature ranges are 90 60 's while as winters are 70 50 's , usually all of southern california have mediterranean climate but snow is very rare in the southwest of the state , it occurs on the southeast of the state
southern california consists of one of the more varied collections of geologic , topographic , and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diversity outnumbering other major regions in the state and country the region spans from pacific ocean islands , shorelines , beaches , and coastal plains , through the transverse and peninsular ranges with their peaks , into the large and small interior valleys , to the vast deserts of california
each year , the southern california area has about 10 , 000 earthquakes nearly all of them are so small that they are not felt only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3 0 , and only about 15 20 are greater than magnitude 4 0 the magnitude 6 7 1994 northridge earthquake was particularly destructive , causing a substantial number of deaths , injuries , and structural collapses it caused the most property damage of any earthquake in u s history , estimated at over 20 billion
many faults are able to produce a magnitude 6 7 earthquake , such as the san andreas fault , which can produce a magnitude 8 0 event other faults include the san jacinto fault , the puente hills fault , and the elsinore fault zone the usgs has released a california earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in california
southern california is divided culturally , politically , and economically into distinctive regions , each containing its own culture and atmosphere , anchored usually by a city with both national and sometimes global recognition , which are often the hub of economic activity for its respective region and being home to many tourist destinations each region is further divided into many culturally distinct areas but as a whole combine to create the southern california atmosphere
as of the 2010 united states census , southern california has a population of 22 , 680 , 010 despite a reputation for high growth rates , southern california 's rate grew less than the state average of 10 0 in the 2000s as california 's growth became concentrated in the northern part of the state due to a stronger , tech oriented economy in the bay area and an emerging greater sacramento region
southern california consists of one combined statistical area , eight metropolitan statistical areas , one international metropolitan area , and multiple metropolitan divisions the region is home to two extended metropolitan areas that exceed five million in population these are the greater los angeles area at 17 , 786 , 419 , and san diego tijuana at 5 , 105 , 768 of these metropolitan areas , the los angeles long beach santa ana metropolitan area , riverside san bernardino ontario metropolitan area , and oxnard thousand oaks ventura metropolitan area form greater los angeles while the el centro metropolitan area and san diego carlsbad san marcos metropolitan area form the southern border region north of greater los angeles are the santa barbara , san luis obispo , and bakersfield metropolitan areas
los angeles \( at 3 7 million people \) and san diego \( at 1 3 million people \) , both in southern california , are the two largest cities in all of california \( and two of the eight largest cities in the united states \) in southern california there are also twelve cities with more than 200 , 000 residents and 34 cities over 100 , 000 in population many of southern california 's most developed cities lie along or in close proximity to the coast , with the exception of san bernardino and riverside
southern california 's economy is diverse and one of the largest in the united states it is dominated and heavily dependent upon abundance of petroleum , as opposed to other regions where automobiles not nearly as dominant , the vast majority of transport runs on this fuel southern california is famous for tourism and hollywood \( film , television , and music \) other industries include software , automotive , ports , finance , tourism , biomedical , and regional logistics the region was a leader in the housing bubble 2001 2007 , and has been heavily impacted by the housing crash
since the 1920s , motion pictures , petroleum and aircraft manufacturing have been major industries in one of the richest agricultural regions in the u s , cattle and citrus were major industries until farmlands were turned into suburbs although military spending cutbacks have had an impact , aerospace continues to be a major factor

stadtholder william iii of orange , who later became king of england , emerged as the strongest opponent of king louis xiv after the french attacked the dutch republic in 1672 william formed the league of augsburg as a coalition to oppose louis and the french state consequently , many huguenots considered the wealthy and calvinist dutch republic , which led the opposition to louis xiv , as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the edict of nantes they also found many french speaking calvinist churches there
renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the huguenots to be abolished following their defeat they retained the religious provisions of the edict of nantes until the rule of louis xiv , who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the edict of fontainebleau \( 1685 \) , which abolished all legal recognition of protestantism in france , and forced the huguenots to convert while nearly three quarters eventually were killed or submitted , roughly 500 , 000 huguenots had fled france by the early 18th century citation needed
the catholic church in france and many of its members opposed the huguenots some huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship the height of this persecution was the st bartholomew 's day massacre when 5 , 000 to 30 , 000 were killed , although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well , as some of the huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern france retaliating against the french catholics , the huguenots had their own militia

the exodus of huguenots from france created a brain drain , as many huguenots had occupied important places in society the kingdom did not fully recover for years the french crown 's refusal to allow non catholics to settle in new france may help to explain that colony 's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring british colonies , which opened settlement to religious dissenters by the time of the french and indian war \( the north american front of the seven years' war \) , a sizeable population of huguenot descent lived in the british colonies , and many participated in the british defeat of new france in 1759 60
the pattern of warfare , followed by brief periods of peace , continued for nearly another quarter century the warfare was definitively quelled in 1598 , when henry of navarre , having succeeded to the french throne as henry iv , and having recanted protestantism in favour of roman catholicism , issued the edict of nantes the edict reaffirmed catholicism as the state religion of france , but granted the protestants equality with catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains the edict simultaneously protected catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new protestant churches in catholic controlled regions citation needed

steam engines are external combustion engines , where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products non combustion heat sources such as solar power , nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used the ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the rankine cycle in the cycle , water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure when expanded through pistons or turbines , mechanical work is done the reduced pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler
the first commercially successful true engine , in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine , was the atmospheric engine , invented by thomas newcomen around 1712 it was an improvement over savery 's steam pump , using a piston as proposed by papin newcomen 's engine was relatively inefficient , and in most cases was used for pumping water it worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder it was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible , and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable head water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel
the first full scale working railway steam locomotive was built by richard trevithick in the united kingdom and , on 21 february 1804 , the world 's first railway journey took place as trevithick 's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the pen y darren ironworks , near merthyr tydfil to abercynon in south wales the design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency trevithick visited the newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north east england became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives
the rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water , so that they may be run continuously utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi stage centrifugal pumps however , other types are used another means of supplying lower pressure boiler feed water is an injector , which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used , except in applications such as steam locomotives
it is a logical extension of the compound engine \( described above \) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency the result is the multiple expansion engine such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively these engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter these cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage as with the double expansion engine , if space is at a premium , then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low pressure stage multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline , but various other formations were used in the late 19th century , the yarrow schlick tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines y s t engines divided the low pressure expansion stages between two cylinders , one at each end of the engine this allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced , resulting in a smoother , faster responding engine which ran with less vibration this made the 4 cylinder triple expansion engine popular with large passenger liners \( such as the olympic class \) , but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration free turbine engine citation needed
in the 1840s and 50s , there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate , variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff the combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events , at the expense of increased friction and wear , and the mechanism tended to be complicated the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut off on the admission side has occurred this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson , joy and walschaerts motions corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms
lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler 's firebox if the water level drops , such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly , the lead melts and the steam escapes , warning the operators , who may then manually suppress the fire except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire the plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly , depressurizing the boiler if they were any larger , the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew citation needed
in 1781 james watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion watt 's ten horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered the engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained by 1883 , engines that could provide 10 , 000 hp had become feasible the stationary steam engine was a key component of the industrial revolution , allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable the atmospheric engines of newcomen and watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced , but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives
the history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century ad the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by greek mathematician hero of alexandria in the following centuries , the few steam powered engines known were , like the aeolipile , essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam a rudimentary steam turbine device was described by taqi al din in 1551 and by giovanni branca in 1629 jer nimo de ayanz y beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions , including a water pump for draining inundated mines denis papin , a huguenot refugee , did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679 , and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690
near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures , giving improved efficiency these stages were called expansions , with double and triple expansion engines being common , especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating \( piston \) steam engines , with shipping in the 20th century relying upon the steam turbine
the final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines \( for outputs above several hundred horsepower \) , have fewer moving parts , and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century , where their efficiency , higher speed appropriate to generator service , and smooth rotation were advantages today most electric power is provided by steam turbines in the united states 90 of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century
the heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources , most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space \( called variously combustion chamber , firebox \) in some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor , geothermal energy , solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process in the case of model or toy steam engines , the heat source can be an electric heating element
the most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator early versions were in use by 1851 , but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer charles porter by charles richard and exhibited at london exhibition in 1862 the steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle , which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower it was routinely used by engineers , mechanics and insurance inspectors the engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines see image of indicator diagram below \( in types of motor units section \)
with two cylinder compounds used in railway work , the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two cylinder simple at 90 out of phase with each other \( quartered \) when the double expansion group is duplicated , producing a 4 cylinder compound , the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180 , the groups being set at 90 to each other in one case \( the first type of vauclain compound \) , the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank , again set at 90 as for a two cylinder engine with the 3 cylinder compound arrangement , the lp cranks were either set at 90 with the hp one at 135 to the other two , or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120 citation needed
in most reciprocating piston engines , the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke \( counterflow \) , entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port the complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes the cycle also comprises four events admission , expansion , exhaust , compression these events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end \( s \) and are driven by valve gear , of which there are many types citation needed
uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where , during each stroke , the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam , whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction by this means , the simple expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part load performance , and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower however , the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties citation needed the quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas , while exhausting in cold areas
an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder instead of valves , the entire cylinder rocks , or oscillates , such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting \( trunnion \) these engines are mainly used in toys and models , because of their simplicity , but have also been used in full size working engines , mainly on ships where their compactness is valued citation needed
the working fluid in a rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system , where the working fluid is recycled continuously , or may be an open loop system , where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere , and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties , such as non toxic and unreactive chemistry , abundance , low cost , and its thermodynamic properties mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle
the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid , the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small in steam turbines , turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 c \( the creep limit of stainless steel \) and condenser temperatures are around 30 c this gives a theoretical carnot efficiency of about 63 compared with an actual efficiency of 42 for a modern coal fired power station this low turbine entry temperature \( compared with a gas turbine \) is why the rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined cycle gas turbine power stations citation needed
steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the industrial revolution and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories , mills and mines powering pumping stations and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives , ships , steamboats and road vehicles their use in agriculture led to an increase in the land available for cultivation there have at one time or another been steam powered farm tractors , motorcycles \( without much success \) and even automobiles as the stanley steamer
trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives , concluding with the catch me who can in 1808 only four years later , the successful twin cylinder locomotive salamanca by matthew murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion middleton railway in 1825 george stephenson built the locomotion for the stockton and darlington railway this was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829 , he built the rocket which was entered in and won the rainhill trials the liverpool and manchester railway opened in 1830 making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains
a method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by british engineer arthur woolf , who patented his woolf high pressure compound engine in 1805 in the compound engine , high pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high pressure \( hp \) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower pressure \( lp \) cylinders the complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each this reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling , increasing the efficiency of the engine by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders , torque variability can be reduced to derive equal work from lower pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume therefore , the bore , and often the stroke , are increased in low pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders
the main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation \( in the 1990s about 90 of the world 's electric production was by use of steam turbines \) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80 regime for steam turbines in electricity production , the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators , which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines in marine service , \( pioneered on the turbinia \) , steam turbines with reduction gearing \( although the turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox \) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century , being more efficient \( and requiring far less maintenance \) than reciprocating steam engines in recent decades , reciprocating diesel engines , and gas turbines , have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications
the rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine the cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production , and utilizes the phase change of water \( boiling water producing steam , condensing exhaust steam , producing liquid water \) \) to provide a practical heat power conversion system the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser the rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications in the 1990s , rankine steam cycles generated about 90 of all electric power used throughout the world , including virtually all solar , biomass , coal and nuclear power plants it is named after william john macquorn rankine , a scottish polymath
the historical measure of a steam engine 's energy efficiency was its duty the concept of duty was first introduced by watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier newcomen designs duty is the number of foot pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel \( 94 pounds \) of coal the best examples of newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million , but most were closer to 5 million watt 's original low pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million , but averaged about 17 this was a three fold improvement over the average newcomen design early watt engines equipped with high pressure steam improved this to 65 million
reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating \( piston \) steam engines in commercial usage , and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines , the steam age is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century
the first commercial steam powered device was a water pump , developed in 1698 by thomas savery it used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below , then it used steam pressure to raise it higher small engines were effective though larger models were problematic they proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions it received some use in mines , pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery an attractive feature of the savery engine was its low cost bento de moura portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of savery 's construction to render it capable of working itself , as described by john smeaton in the philosophical transactions published in 1751 it continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century one engine was still known to be operating in 1820
around 1800 richard trevithick and , separately , oliver evans in 1801 introduced engines using high pressure steam trevithick obtained his high pressure engine patent in 1802 these were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications thereafter , technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques \( partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source \) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller , faster , or more powerful , depending on the intended application
although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use , various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines the company energiprojekt ab in sweden has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam the efficiency of energiprojekt 's steam engine reaches some 27 30 on high pressure engines it is a single step , 5 cylinder engine \( no compound \) with superheated steam and consumes approx 4 kg \( 8 8 lb \) of steam per kwh not in citation given
where chp is not used , steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink the condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans , rivers , lakes , and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal the resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly evaporative \( wet \) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water this water is kept separate from the condensate , which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than once through cooling by river or lake water a 700 megawatt coal fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make up water every hour for evaporative cooling , but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water citation needed
the centrifugal governor was adopted by james watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after watt s partner boulton saw one at a flour mill boulton watt were building the governor could not actually hold a set speed , because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes the governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler also , there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change as a consequence , engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed , such as cotton spinning the governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off , good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century
the adoption of compounding was common for industrial units , for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880 it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated this is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge \( particularly in britain , where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930 \) however , although never in the majority , it was popular in many other countries
the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually shortening the cutoff or rather , shortening the admission event this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period however , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression \( kick back \) citation needed
using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years , but early devices were not practical the spanish inventor jer nimo de ayanz y beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine in 1606 in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped savery 's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber , and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water thomas newcomen 's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston , and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine
a steam turbine consists of one or more rotors \( rotating discs \) mounted on a drive shaft , alternating with a series of stators \( static discs \) fixed to the turbine casing the rotors have a propeller like arrangement of blades at the outer edge steam acts upon these blades , producing rotary motion the stator consists of a similar , but fixed , series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage a steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum the stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam , giving rise to a series of variably sized high and low pressure stages turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed , therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications , such as a ship 's propeller in the vast majority of large electric generating stations , turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute \( rpm \) in the usa with 60 hertz power , 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems in nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds , 1800 rpm and 1500 rpm a turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction therefore , a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction citation needed
the weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power to weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines for mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors however , most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant , so that indirectly the world 's industry is still dependent on steam power recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover this is becoming known as the advanced steam movement citation needed
it is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine many such engines have been designed , from the time of james watt to the present day , but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production see link at bottom of article for more details the major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion the resulting leakage made them very inefficient lack of expansive working , or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs citation needed
the next major step occurred when james watt developed \( 1763 1775 \) an improved version of newcomen 's engine , with a separate condenser boulton and watt 's early engines used half as much coal as john smeaton 's improved version of newcomen 's newcomen 's and watt 's early engines were atmospheric they were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam , instead of the pressure of expanding steam the engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure
steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high one may be adjusted by the user , the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail safe such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler one end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers , leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring loaded valve , which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken this arrangement is considerably safer citation needed
the acme of the horizontal engine was the corliss steam engine , patented in 1849 , which was a four valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff when corliss was given the rumford medal the committee said that no one invention since watt 's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine in addition to using 30 less steam , it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off , making it well suited to manufacturing , especially cotton spinning
the steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory however , the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam the experimental measurements made by watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser watt independently discovered latent heat , which was confirmed by the original discoverer joseph black , who also advised watt on experimental procedures watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure otherwise , the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature the thermodynamic concepts of the rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high pressure and temperature boilers and the steam turbine
one of the principal advantages the rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump , the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point by condensing the fluid , the work required by the pump consumes only 1 to 3 of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle the benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature gas turbines , for instance , have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 c nonetheless , the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched citation needed
other components are often present pumps \( such as an injector \) to supply water to the boiler during operation , condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation , and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point , and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes when coal is used , a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin \( bunker \) to the firebox see mechanical stoker
land based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam , as feed water was usually readily available prior to and during world war i , the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential it was however superseded by the british invention steam turbine where speed was required , for instance in warships , such as the dreadnought battleships , and ocean liners hms dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then novel steam turbine citation needed
virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator nuclear powered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion , with generators providing auxiliary power , or else employ turbo electric transmission , where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors a limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured some non condensing direct drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in sweden and for express passenger work in britain , but were not repeated elsewhere , notably in the u s a , more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally , but not reproduced it was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done citation needed
the rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical carnot cycle because , when an efficient turbine is used , the ts diagram begins to resemble the carnot cycle the main difference is that heat addition \( in the boiler \) and rejection \( in the condenser \) are isobaric \( constant pressure \) processes in the rankine cycle and isothermal \( constant temperature \) processes in the theoretical carnot cycle in this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor \( as in the carnot cycle \) the cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages
oxygen is a chemical element with symbol o and atomic number 8 it is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds \( notably oxides \) with most elements by mass , oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium at standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula o 2 diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20 8 of the earth 's atmosphere however , monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend , because of fossil fuel burning oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the earth 's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide , making up almost half of the crust 's mass
many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , contain oxygen , as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells , teeth , and bone most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water , the major constituent of lifeforms oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water it is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms another form \( allotrope \) of oxygen , ozone \( o 3 \) , strongly absorbs uvb radiation and consequently the high altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation , but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by product of smog at even higher low earth orbit altitudes , sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft
in the late 17th century , robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion english chemist john mayow \( 1641 1679 \) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus in one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one fourteenth of the air 's volume before extinguishing the subjects from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion
in the meantime , on august 1 , 1774 , an experiment conducted by the british clergyman joseph priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide \( hgo \) inside a glass tube , which liberated a gas he named dephlogisticated air he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it after breathing the gas himself , he wrote the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled an account of further discoveries in air which was included in the second volume of his book titled experiments and observations on different kinds of air because he published his findings first , priestley is usually given priority in the discovery
one of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century bce greek writer on mechanics , philo of byzantium in his work pneumatica , philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel 's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass many centuries later leonardo da vinci built on philo 's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration
highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity an ignition event , such as heat or a spark , is needed to trigger combustion oxygen is the oxidant , not the fuel , but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential , such as peroxides , chlorates , nitrates , perchlorates , and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire
concentrated o 2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel and therefore the design and manufacture of o 2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized the fire that killed the apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure o 2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure , instead of the 1 3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission k
oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide \( co 2 \) the earth 's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon \( silica sio 2 , as found in granite and quartz \) , aluminium \( aluminium oxide al 2o 3 , in bauxite and corundum \) , iron \( iron \( iii \) oxide fe 2o 3 , in hematite and rust \) , and calcium carbonate \( in limestone \) the rest of the earth 's crust is also made of oxygen compounds , in particular various complex silicates \( in silicate minerals \) the earth 's mantle , of much larger mass than the crust , is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron
john dalton 's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another for example , dalton assumed that water 's formula was ho , giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen , instead of the modern value of about 16 in 1805 , joseph louis gay lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen and by 1811 amedeo avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water 's composition , based on what is now called avogadro 's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules a
highly combustible materials that leave little residue , such as wood or coal , were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston whereas non combustible substances that corrode , such as iron , contained very little air did not play a role in phlogiston theory , nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea instead , it was based on observations of what happens when something burns , that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process the fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products indeed , one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals , too , gain weight in rusting \( when they were supposedly losing phlogiston \)
in this dioxygen , the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other the bond can be variously described based on level of theory , but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms , the filling of which results in a bond order of two more specifically , the double bond is the result of sequential , low to high energy , or aufbau , filling of orbitals , and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons , after sequential filling of the low and orbitals overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the o o molecular axis and overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the o o molecular axis , and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest and orbitals
oxygen was discovered independently by carl wilhelm scheele , in uppsala , in 1773 or earlier , and joseph priestley in wiltshire , in 1774 , but priestley is often given priority because his work was published first the name oxygen was coined in 1777 by antoine lavoisier , whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion its name derives from the greek roots oxys , acid , literally sharp , referring to the sour taste of acids and genes , producer , literally begetter , because at the time of naming , it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel , plastics and textiles , brazing , welding and cutting of steels and other metals , rocket propellant , in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft , submarines , spaceflight and diving
this combination of cancellations and and overlaps results in dioxygen 's double bond character and reactivity , and a triplet electronic ground state an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen \( see the filled orbitals in the diagram \) , orbitals that are of equal energy i e , degenerate is a configuration termed a spin triplet state hence , the ground state of the o 2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen b the highest energy , partially filled orbitals are antibonding , and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two because of its unpaired electrons , triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules , which have paired electron spins this prevents spontaneous combustion
in one experiment , lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container he noted that air rushed in when he opened the container , which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed he also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in this and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book sur la combustion en g n ral , which was published in 1777 in that work , he proved that air is a mixture of two gases 'vital air' , which is essential to combustion and respiration , and azote \( gk lifeless \) , which did not support either azote later became nitrogen in english , although it has kept the name in french and several other european languages
trioxygen \( o 3 \) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when o 2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o 2 by ultraviolet \( uv \) radiation since ozone absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum , the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet near the earth 's surface , it is a pollutant formed as a by product of automobile exhaust the metastable molecule tetraoxygen \( o 4 \) was discovered in 2001 , and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen it was proven in 2006 that this phase , created by pressurizing o 2 to 20 gpa , is in fact a rhombohedral o 8 cluster this cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o 2 or o 3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel a metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 gpa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures , this phase becomes superconducting
the common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth is called dioxygen , o 2 it is the form that is a major part of the earth 's atmosphere \( see occurrence \) o2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kj mol 1 , which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of o2 with any organic molecule due to its energy content , o2 is used by complex forms of life , such as animals , in cellular respiration \( see biological role \) other aspects of o 2 are covered in the remainder of this article
in 1891 scottish chemist james dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by german engineer carl von linde and british engineer william hampson both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them later , in 1901 , oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed o 2 this method of welding and cutting metal later became common
oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen is water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved o 2 for every 2 molecules of n 2 , compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1 4 the solubility of oxygen in water is temperature dependent , and about twice as much \( 14 6 mg l 1 \) dissolves at 0 c than at 20 c \( 7 6 mg l 1 \) at 25 c and 1 standard atmosphere \( 101 3 kpa \) of air , freshwater contains about 6 04 milliliters \( ml \) of oxygen per liter , whereas seawater contains about 4 95 ml per liter at 5 c the solubility increases to 9 0 ml \( 50 more than at 25 c \) per liter for water and 7 2 ml \( 45 more \) per liter for sea water
oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the earth 's biosphere , air , sea and land oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium about 0 9 of the sun 's mass is oxygen oxygen constitutes 49 2 of the earth 's crust by mass and is the major component of the world 's oceans \( 88 8 by mass \) oxygen gas is the second most common component of the earth 's atmosphere , taking up 20 8 of its volume and 23 1 of its mass \( some 1015 tonnes \) d earth is unusual among the planets of the solar system in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere mars \( with 0 1 o 2 by volume \) and venus have far lower concentrations the o 2 surrounding these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation impacting oxygen containing molecules such as carbon dioxide
by the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied , and its components isolated , by compressing and cooling it using a cascade method , swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide , which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it he sent a telegram on december 22 , 1877 to the french academy of sciences in paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen just two days later , french physicist louis paul cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen only a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analysis could be conducted oxygen was liquified in stable state for the first time on march 29 , 1883 by polish scientists from jagiellonian university , zygmunt wr blewski and karol olszewski
planetary geologists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in samples from the earth , the moon , mars , and meteorites , but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the sun , believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed genesis spacecraft has shown that the sun has a higher proportion of oxygen 16 than does the earth the measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen 16 from the sun 's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the earth
singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher energy species of molecular o 2 in which all the electron spins are paired it is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se in nature , singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis , using the energy of sunlight it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength , and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms \( and possibly also in animals \) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues
paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen 18 and oxygen 16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago \( see oxygen isotope ratio cycle \) seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope , oxygen 16 , evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 heavier oxygen 18 this disparity increases at lower temperatures during periods of lower global temperatures , snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen 16 , and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen 18 marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen 18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples that are up to several hundreds of thousands of years old
oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform this approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation 's reflectance from its fluorescence , which is much weaker the measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal to noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale
in the triplet form , o 2 molecules are paramagnetic that is , they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field , because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule , and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o 2 molecules liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that , in laboratory demonstrations , a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet c
reactive oxygen species , such as superoxide ion \( o 2 \) and hydrogen peroxide \( h 2o 2 \) , are dangerous by products of oxygen use in organisms parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide , superoxide , and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms , which were the dominant form of early life on earth until o 2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2 5 billion years ago during the great oxygenation event , about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms
oxygen condenses at 90 20 k \( 182 95 c , 297 31 f \) , and freezes at 54 36 k \( 218 79 c , 361 82 f \) both liquid and solid o 2 are clear substances with a light sky blue color caused by absorption in the red \( in contrast with the blue color of the sky , which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light \) high purity liquid o 2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air , using liquid nitrogen as a coolant it is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials
free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world 's water bodies the increased solubility of o 2 at lower temperatures \( see physical properties \) has important implications for ocean life , as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o 2 in eutrophic water bodies scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water 's biochemical oxygen demand , or the amount of o 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration
free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in earth 's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved , probably about 3 5 billion years ago free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon \( between 3 0 and 2 3 billion years ago \) for the first billion years , any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations when such oxygen sinks became saturated , free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3 2 7 billion years ago , reaching 10 of its present level around 1 7 billion years ago
the unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on earth is the result of the oxygen cycle this biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on earth the atmosphere , the biosphere , and the lithosphere the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis , which is responsible for modern earth 's atmosphere photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere , while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere in the present equilibrium , production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1 2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year
the other major method of producing o 2 gas involves passing a stream of clean , dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves , which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 to 93 o 2 simultaneously , nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen saturated zeolite bed , by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it , in the reverse direction of flow after a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged , thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline this is known as pressure swing adsorption oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non cryogenic technologies \( see also the related vacuum swing adsorption \)
oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen dc electricity must be used if ac is used , the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2 1 contrary to popular belief , the 2 1 ratio observed in the dc electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is h2o unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves a similar method is the electrocatalytic o 2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids chemical catalysts can be used as well , such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life support equipment on submarines , and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current , to produce nearly pure o 2 gas
oxygen , as a supposed mild euphoric , has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports oxygen bars are establishments , found in japan , california , and las vegas , nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal o 2 exposure for a fee professional athletes , especially in american football , also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a boost in performance the pharmacological effect is doubtful a placebo effect is a more likely explanation available studies support a performance boost from enriched o 2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise
hyperbaric \( high pressure \) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o 2 around the patient and , when needed , the medical staff carbon monoxide poisoning , gas gangrene , and decompression sickness \( the 'bends' \) are sometimes treated using these devices increased o 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene , so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive , resulting in bubbles of inert gas , mostly nitrogen and helium , forming in their blood increasing the pressure of o 2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment
uptake of o 2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration , so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient 's blood , but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs , easing work load on the heart oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema , pneumonia , some heart disorders \( congestive heart failure \) , some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure , and any disease that impairs the body 's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen
due to its electronegativity , oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides the surface of most metals , such as aluminium and titanium , are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion many oxides of the transition metals are non stoichiometric compounds , with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show for example , the mineral feo \( w stite \) is written as fe 1 xo , where x is usually around 0 05
people who climb mountains or fly in non pressurized fixed wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental o 2 supplies h passengers traveling in \( pressurized \) commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of o 2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat , causing oxygen masks to drop pulling on the masks to start the flow of oxygen as cabin safety instructions dictate , forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister a steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction
oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks , cryogenics and chemical compounds for reasons of economy , oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers , since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 c \( 68 f \) such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers , which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers , which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy fuel welding and cutting
among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are \( where r is an organic group \) alcohols \( r oh \) ethers \( r o r \) ketones \( r co r \) aldehydes \( r co h \) carboxylic acids \( r cooh \) esters \( r coo r \) acid anhydrides \( r co o co r \) and amides \( r c \( o \) nr 2 \) there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen , including acetone , methanol , ethanol , isopropanol , furan , thf , diethyl ether , dioxane , ethyl acetate , dmf , dmso , acetic acid , and formic acid acetone \( \( ch 3 \) 2co \) and phenol \( c 6h 5oh \) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are glycerol , formaldehyde , glutaraldehyde , citric acid , acetic anhydride , and acetamide epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms
the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to \( or generated by \) life only a few common complex biomolecules , such as squalene and the carotenes , contain no oxygen of the organic compounds with biological relevance , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen all fats , fatty acids , amino acids , and proteins contain oxygen \( due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues \) oxygen also occurs in phosphate \( po3 4 \) groups in the biologically important energy carrying molecules atp and adp , in the backbone and the purines \( except adenine \) and pyrimidines of rna and dna , and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite
oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o 2 partial pressure more than 60 kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis exposure to a o 2 partial pressures greater than 160 kpa \( about 1 6 atm \) may lead to convulsions \( normally fatal for divers \) acute oxygen toxicity \( causing seizures , its most feared effect for divers \) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 o 2 at 66 m or more of depth the same thing can occur by breathing 100 o 2 at only 6 m
breathing pure o 2 in space applications , such as in some modern space suits , or in early spacecraft such as apollo , causes no damage due to the low total pressures used in the case of spacesuits , the o 2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is , in general , about 30 kpa \( 1 4 times normal \) , and the resulting o 2 partial pressure in the astronaut 's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea level o 2 partial pressure \( for more information on this , see space suit and arterial blood gas \)
oxygen gas \( o 2 \) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures , leading to convulsions and other health problems j oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals \( kpa \) , equal to about 50 oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2 5 times the normal sea level o 2 partial pressure of about 21 kpa this is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators , since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30 50 o 2 by volume \( about 30 kpa at standard pressure \) \( although this figure also is subject to wide variation , depending on type of mask \)
the 1973 oil crisis began in october 1973 when the members of the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries \( oapec , consisting of the arab members of opec plus egypt and syria \) proclaimed an oil embargo by the end of the embargo in march 1974 , the price of oil had risen from us 3 per barrel to nearly 12 globally us prices were significantly higher the embargo caused an oil crisis , or shock , with many short and long term effects on global politics and the global economy it was later called the first oil shock , followed by the 1979 oil crisis , termed the second oil shock
the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within nato some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents to address this , the nixon administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights by january 18 , 1974 , us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974
on august 15 , 1971 , the united states unilaterally pulled out of the bretton woods accord the us abandoned the gold exchange standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar , whose value was left to float \( rise and fall according to market demand \) shortly thereafter , britain followed , floating the pound sterling the other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time , the industrialized nations increased their reserves \( by expanding their money supplies \) in amounts far greater than before the result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies because oil was priced in dollars , oil producers' real income decreased in september 1971 , opec issued a joint communiqu stating that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold
this contributed to the oil shock after 1971 , opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation from 1947 to 1967 , the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year until the oil shock , the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities opec ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions , so their real incomes lagged the substantial price increases of 1973 1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold
on october 6 , 1973 , syria and egypt , with support from other arab nations , launched a surprise attack on israel , on yom kippur this renewal of hostilities in the arab israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices at the time , iran was the world 's second largest oil exporter and a close us ally weeks later , the shah of iran said in an interview of course the price of oil is going to rise certainly ! and how ! you 've western nations increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent , and the same for sugar and cement you buy our crude oil and sell it back to us , refined as petrochemicals , at a hundred times the price you 've paid us it 's only fair that , from now on , you should pay more for oil let 's say ten times more
in response to american aid to israel , on october 16 , 1973 , opec raised the posted price of oil by 70 , to 5 11 a barrel the following day , oil ministers agreed to the embargo , a cut in production by five percent from september 's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met on october 19 , nixon requested congress to appropriate 2 2 billion in emergency aid to israel , including 1 5 billion in outright grants george lenczowski notes , military supplies did not exhaust nixon 's eagerness to prevent israel 's collapse this 2 2 billion decision triggered a collective opec response libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the united states saudi arabia and the other arab oil producing states joined the embargo on october 20 , 1973 at their kuwait meeting , oapec proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the us as a principal hostile country
some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities , amid shrinking western demand much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions , particularly in the middle east saudi arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of islam , known as wahhabism , throughout the world , via religious charities such al haramain foundation , which often also distributed funds to violent sunni extremist groups such as al qaeda and the taliban
in the united states , scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973 the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil further , interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissinger 's dominance in the us production , distribution and price disruptions have been held responsible for recessions , periods of excessive inflation , reduced productivity , and lower economic growth
the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to u s energy security on an international level , the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries , such as automobiles macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , even in rugged terrain such as the arctic finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production
the embargo was not uniform across europe of the nine members of the european economic community \( eec \) , the netherlands faced a complete embargo , the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies \( having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis \) , while the other six faced partial cutbacks the uk had traditionally been an ally of israel , and harold wilson 's government supported the israelis during the six day war his successor , ted heath , reversed this policy in 1970 , calling for israel to withdraw to its pre 1967 borders
despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo , the uk nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973 74 became a major factor in the change of government heath asked the british to heat only one room in their houses over the winter the uk , germany , italy , switzerland and norway banned flying , driving and boating on sundays sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil the netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity
price controls exacerbated the crisis in the us the system limited the price of old oil \( that which had already been discovered \) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment predictably , old oil was withdrawn from the market , creating greater scarcity the rule also discouraged development of alternative energies the rule had been intended to promote oil exploration scarcity was addressed by rationing \( as in many countries \) motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973
in 1973 , nixon named william e simon as the first administrator of the federal energy office , a short term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972 , which worked for states whose populations were not increasing in other states , lines at gasoline stations were common the american automobile association reported that in the last week of february 1974 , 20 of american gasoline stations had no fuel
to help reduce consumption , in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph \( about 88 km h \) was imposed through the emergency highway energy conservation act development of the strategic petroleum reserve began in 1975 , and in 1977 the cabinet level department of energy was created , followed by the national energy act of 1978 citation needed on november 28 , 1995 , bill clinton signed the national highway designation act , ending the federal 55 mph \( 89 km h \) speed limit , allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit
the energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy , nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels there is criticism that american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis mentality thinking , promoting expensive quick fixes and single shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation , congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient , but whose prospects are doubtful
in 2004 , declassified documents revealed that the u s was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late 1973 although no explicit plan was mentioned , a conversation between u s secretary of defense james schlesinger and british ambassador to the united states lord cromer revealed schlesinger had told him that it was no longer obvious to him that the u s could not use force british prime minister edward heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a british intelligence estimate of u s intentions , which concluded america might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the u s and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries , and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in saudi arabia and kuwait , and possibly abu dhabi in military action was decided upon although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force , intelligence warned the american occupation would need to last 10 years as the west developed alternative energy sources , and would result in the total alienation of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world
although lacking historical connections to the middle east , japan was the country most dependent on arab oil 71 of its imported oil came from the middle east in 1970 on november 7 , 1973 , the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a nonfriendly country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy it received a 5 production cut in december , causing a panic on november 22 , japan issued a statement asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories , advocating palestinian self determination , and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions by december 25 , japan was considered an arab friendly state
the ussr 's invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region , also marked by increased american weapons sales , technology , and outright military presence saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues both states were competing for preeminence in the persian gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries by 1979 , saudi arms purchases from the us exceeded five times israel 's another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran , a non arabic but largely shiite muslim nation , which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution saudi arabia , on the other hand , is an arab , largely sunni muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism , a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich al hasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year in november 2010 , wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the united states and its allies which revealed that the late saudi king abdullah urged the united states to attack iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program , describing iran as a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination
the crisis reduced the demand for large cars japanese imports , primarily the toyota corona , the toyota corolla , the datsun b210 , the datsun 510 , the honda civic , the mitsubishi galant \( a captive import from chrysler sold as the dodge colt \) , the subaru dl , and later the honda accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical american v8 and six cylinder engines japanese imports became mass market leaders with unibody construction and front wheel drive , which became de facto standards
some buyers lamented the small size of the first japanese compacts , and both toyota and nissan \( then known as datsun \) introduced larger cars such as the toyota corona mark ii , the toyota cressida , the mazda 616 and datsun 810 , which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning , power steering , am fm radios , and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle a decade after the 1973 oil crisis , honda , toyota and nissan , affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints , opened us assembly plants and established their luxury divisions \( acura , lexus and infiniti , respectively \) to distinguish themselves from their mass market brands
compact trucks were introduced , such as the toyota hilux and the datsun truck , followed by the mazda truck \( sold as the ford courier \) , and the isuzu built chevrolet luv mitsubishi rebranded its forte as the dodge d 50 a few years after the oil crisis mazda , mitsubishi and isuzu had joint partnerships with ford , chrysler , and gm , respectively later the american makers introduced their domestic replacements \( ford ranger , dodge dakota and the chevrolet s10 gmc s 15 \) , ending their captive import policy
an increase in imported cars into north america forced general motors , ford and chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel efficient models for domestic sales the dodge omni plymouth horizon from chrysler , the ford fiesta and the chevrolet chevette all had four cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s by 1985 , the average american vehicle moved 17 4 miles per gallon , compared to 13 5 in 1970 the improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at 12 from 1974 to 1979 sales of large sedans for most makes \( except chrysler products \) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis the cadillac deville and fleetwood , buick electra , oldsmobile 98 , lincoln continental , mercury marquis , and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid 1970s the only full size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the chevrolet bel air , and ford galaxie 500 slightly smaller , mid size models such as the oldsmobile cutlass , chevrolet monte carlo , ford thunderbird and various other models sold well
federal safety standards , such as nhtsa federal motor vehicle safety standard 215 \( pertaining to safety bumpers \) , and compacts like the 1974 mustang i were a prelude to the dot downsize revision of vehicle categories by 1977 , gm 's full sized cars reflected the crisis by 1979 , virtually all full size american cars had shrunk , featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions chrysler ended production of their full sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year , moving instead to a full front wheel drive lineup for 1982 \( except for the m body dodge diplomat plymouth gran fury and chrysler new yorker fifth avenue sedans \)
opec soon lost its preeminent position , and in 1981 , its production was surpassed by that of other countries additionally , its own member nations were divided saudi arabia , trying to recover market share , increased production , pushing prices down , shrinking or eliminating profits for high cost producers the world price , which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly 40 per barrel , decreased during the 1980s to less than 10 per barrel adjusted for inflation , oil briefly fell back to pre 1973 levels this sale price was a windfall for oil importing nations , both developing and developed
the apollo program , also known as project apollo , was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration \( nasa \) , which accomplished landing the first humans on the moon from 1969 to 1972 first conceived during dwight d eisenhower 's administration as a three man spacecraft to follow the one man project mercury which put the first americans in space , apollo was later dedicated to president john f kennedy 's national goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth by the end of the 1960s , which he proposed in a may 25 , 1961 , address to congress project mercury was followed by the two man project gemini \( 1962 66 \) the first manned flight of apollo was in 1968
apollo ran from 1961 to 1972 , and was supported by the two man gemini program which ran concurrently with it from 1962 to 1966 gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the apollo missions apollo used saturn family rockets as launch vehicles apollo saturn vehicles were also used for an apollo applications program , which consisted of skylab , a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973 74 , and the apollo soyuz test project , a joint earth orbit mission with the soviet union in 1975
the apollo program succeeded in achieving its goal of manned lunar landing , despite the major setback of a 1967 apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test after the first landing , sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings , but the apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon , which disabled the command spacecraft 's propulsion and life support the crew returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as a lifeboat for these functions
apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body , while the final apollo 17 mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit the program returned 842 pounds \( 382 kg \) of lunar rocks and soil to earth , greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon 's composition and geological history the program laid the foundation for nasa 's current human spaceflight capability , and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight , including avionics , telecommunications , and computers
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early 1960 , as a follow up to project mercury while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission , apollo would carry three astronauts possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station , circumlunar flights , and eventual manned lunar landings the program was named after the greek god of light , music , and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein , who later said that i was naming the spacecraft like i 'd name my baby silverstein chose the name at home one evening , early in 1960 , because he felt apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program
in july 1960 , nasa deputy administrator hugh l dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module \( piloting and re entry cabin \) , and a propulsion and equipment module on august 30 , a feasibility study competition was announced , and on october 25 , three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics convair , general electric , and the glenn l martin company meanwhile , nasa performed its own in house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget , to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs
in november 1960 , john f kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense up to the election of 1960 , kennedy had been speaking out against the missile gap that he and many other senators felt had formed between the soviets and themselves due to the inaction of president eisenhower beyond military power , kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige , pledging to make the us not first but , first and , first if , but first period despite kennedy 's rhetoric , he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president he knew little about the technical details of the space program , and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing when kennedy 's newly appointed nasa administrator james e webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency , kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa 's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue
on april 12 , 1961 , soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space , reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarin 's flight , many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news , refusing to make a commitment on america 's response to the soviets
on april 20 , kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b johnson , asking johnson to look into the status of america 's space program , and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up johnson responded approximately one week later , concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first
it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of robert r gilruth 's space task group , which had been directing the nation 's manned space program from nasa 's langley research center so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center , the manned spacecraft center \( msc \) a site was chosen in houston , texas , on land donated by rice university , and administrator webb announced the conversion on september 19 , 1961 it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida , so a new mission control center would be included in the msc
it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the saturn i and ib rockets at the northernmost end lc 34 and lc 37 but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission , so land acquisition was started in july 1961 for a launch operations center \( loc \) immediately north of canaveral at merritt island the design , development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h debus , a member of dr wernher von braun 's original v 2 rocket engineering team debus was named the loc 's first director construction began in november 1962 upon kennedy 's death , president johnson issued an executive order on november 29 , 1963 , to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy
the loc included launch complex 39 , a launch control center , and a 130 million cubic foot \( 3 7 million cubic meter \) vertical assembly building \( vab \) in which the space vehicle \( launch vehicle and spacecraft \) would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads although at least three pads were planned , only two , designated a and b , were completed in october 1965 the loc also included an operations and checkout building \( ocb \) to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250 , 000 feet \( 76 km \) , which is nearly a vacuum
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control , he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization , so he recruited dr george e mueller for a high management job mueller accepted , on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo webb then worked with associate administrator \( later deputy administrator \) robert seamans to reorganize the office of manned space flight \( omsf \) on july 23 , 1963 , webb announced mueller 's appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight , to replace then associate administrator d brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september 1 under webb 's reorganization , the directors of the manned spacecraft center \( gilruth \) marshall space flight center \( von braun \) and the launch operations center \( debus \) effectively reported to mueller
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects , mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high ranking officers in the united states air force , so he got webb 's permission to recruit general samuel c phillips , who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program , as omsf program controller phillips' superior officer bernard a schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa , along with a staff of officers under him , on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director mueller agreed , and phillips managed apollo from january 1964 , until it achieved the first manned landing in july 1969 , after which he returned to air force duty
in early 1961 , direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa many engineers feared that a rendezvous let alone a docking neither of which had been attempted even in earth orbit , would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit dissenters including john houbolt at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach throughout 1960 and 1961 , houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option bypassing the nasa hierarchy , he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans while acknowledging that he spoke somewhat as a voice in the wilderness , houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question
seamans' establishment of an ad hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e golovin in july 1961 , to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program , represented a turning point in nasa 's mission mode decision this committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice , and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor lor mode its consideration of lor as well as houbolt 's ceaseless work played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach in late 1961 and early 1962 , members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor , including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight , joseph shea , who became a champion of lor the engineers at marshall space flight center \( msfc \) took longer to become convinced of its merits , but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing in june 1962
but even after nasa reached internal agreement , it was far from smooth sailing kennedy 's science advisor jerome wiesner , who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office , and had opposed the decision to land men on the moon , hired golovin , who had left nasa , to chair his own space vehicle panel , ostensibly to monitor , but actually to second guess nasa 's decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea , seamans , and even webb to defend themselves , delaying its formal announcement to the press on july 11 , 1962 , and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as tentative
wiesner kept up the pressure , even making the disagreement public during a two day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center wiesner blurted out no , that 's no good in front of the press , during a presentation by von braun webb jumped in and defended von braun , until kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was still subject to final review webb held firm , and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module \( lem \) contractors wiesner finally relented , unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in kennedy 's office , because of the president 's involvement with the october cuban missile crisis , and fear of kennedy 's support for webb nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november 1962
the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen a 1964 msc study concluded , the lm as lifeboat was finally dropped , because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps ironically , just such a failure happened on apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power the lunar module provided propulsion , electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely
maxime faget 's preliminary apollo design employed a cone shaped command module , supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power , sized appropriately for the space station , cislunar , and lunar landing missions once kennedy 's moon landing goal became official , detailed design began of a command service module \( csm \) in which the crew would spend the entire direct ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip , after being soft landed by a larger landing propulsion module the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csm 's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew , along with a new spacecraft , the lunar excursion module \( lem , later shortened to lunar module , lm \) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm
the command module \( cm \) was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield , and had its own reaction control system \( rcs \) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown the module was 11 42 feet \( 3 48 m \) tall , 12 83 feet \( 3 91 m \) in diameter , and weighed approximately 12 , 250 pounds \( 5 , 560 kg \)
a cylindrical service module \( sm \) supported the command module , with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants , and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants a high gain s band antenna was used for long distance communications on the lunar flights on the extended lunar missions , an orbital scientific instrument package was carried the service module was discarded just before re entry the module was 24 6 feet \( 7 5 m \) long and 12 83 feet \( 3 91 m \) in diameter the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51 , 300 pounds \( 23 , 300 kg \) fully fueled , while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54 , 000 pounds \( 24 , 000 kg \)
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm , and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous , the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off of the moon , and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight also , there was no provision for docking with the lunar module a 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing , while block ii , the actual lunar spacecraft , would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development
the lunar module \( lm \) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module not designed to fly through the earth 's atmosphere or return to earth , its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations , and was of an extremely lightweight construction it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages , each with its own engine the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant , surface stay consumables , and surface exploration equipment the ascent stage contained the crew cabin , ascent propellant , and a reaction control system the initial lm model weighed approximately 33 , 300 pounds \( 15 , 100 kg \) , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours an extended lunar module weighed over 36 , 200 pounds \( 16 , 400 kg \) , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days
before the apollo program began , wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles , the saturn series , and the even larger nova series in the midst of these plans , von braun was transferred from the army to nasa , and made director of the marshall space flight center the initial direct ascent plan to send the three man apollo command service module directly to the lunar surface , on top of a large descent rocket stage , would require a nova class launcher , with a lunar payload capability of over 180 , 000 pounds \( 82 , 000 kg \) the june 11 , 1962 , decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova , and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc 34 , with only live first stages , carrying dummy upper stages filled with water the first flight with a live s iv was launched from lc 37 this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms \( designated as 101 through as 105 \) into orbit in 1964 and 1965 the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites , which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts
the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i the s ib first stage increased the thrust to 1 , 600 , 000 pounds force \( 7 , 120 kn \) , and the second stage replaced the s iv with the s ivb 200 , powered by a single j 2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox , to produce 200 , 000 lbf \( 890 kn \) of thrust a restartable version of the s ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v the saturn ib could send over 40 , 000 pounds \( 18 , 100 kg \) into low earth orbit , sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as 200 series number , as indicating apollo saturn and the 2 indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family
the three stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon it was 33 feet \( 10 1 m \) in diameter and stood 363 feet \( 110 6 m \) tall with its 96 , 800 pound \( 43 , 900 kg \) lunar payload its capability grew to 103 , 600 pounds \( 47 , 000 kg \) for the later advanced lunar landings the s ic first stage burned rp 1 lox for a rated thrust of 7 , 500 , 000 pounds force \( 33 , 400 kn \) , which was upgraded to 7 , 610 , 000 pounds force \( 33 , 900 kn \) the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen , and the third stage was a modified version of the s ivb , with thrust increased to 230 , 000 lbf \( 1 , 020 kn \) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans , plus from two later astronaut groups all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans crews on all development flights \( except the earth orbit csm development flights \) through the first two landings on apollo 11 and apollo 12 , included at least two \( sometimes three \) gemini veterans dr harrison schmitt , a geologist , was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space , and landed on the moon on the last mission , apollo 17 schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews
nasa awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor , the distinguished service medal , given for distinguished service , ability , or courage , and personal contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom , white , and chaffee in 1969 , then to the crews of all missions from apollo 8 onward the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo 7 , walter m schirra , donn eisele , and walter cunningham , were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal , because of discipline problems with the flight director 's orders during their flight the nasa administrator in october , 2008 , decided to award them the distinguished service medals , by this time posthumously to schirra and eisele
two block i csms were launched from lc 34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the saturn ib the first , as 201 launched on february 26 , reached an altitude of 265 7 nautical miles \( 492 1 km \) and splashed down 4 , 577 nautical miles \( 8 , 477 km \) downrange in the atlantic ocean the second , as 202 on august 25 , reached 617 1 nautical miles \( 1 , 142 9 km \) altitude and was recovered 13 , 900 nautical miles \( 25 , 700 km \) downrange in the pacific ocean these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield
after an unmanned lm test flight as 206 , a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as 207 208 , or as 278 \( each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib \) the block ii crew positions were titled commander \( cdr \) command module pilot \( cmp \) and lunar module pilot \( lmp \) the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo spacesuit , designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity \( eva \) the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear fishbowl type for greater visibility , and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water cooled undergarment
deke slayton , the grounded mercury astronaut who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs , selected the first apollo crew in january 1966 , with grissom as command pilot , white as senior pilot , and rookie donn f eisele as pilot but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc135 weightlessness training aircraft , and had to undergo surgery on january 27 slayton replaced him with chaffee nasa announced the final crew selection for as 204 on march 21 , 1966 , with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans james mcdivitt and david scott , with rookie russell l rusty schweickart mercury gemini veteran wally schirra , eisele , and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september 29 as the prime crew for as 205
in december 1966 , the as 205 mission was canceled , since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the 14 day first flight , and as 205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission , now redesignated as 205 208 or as 258 , planned for august 1967 mcdivitt , scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as 258 crew , and schirra , eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo 1 backup crew
the problems with north american were severe enough in late 1965 to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a tiger team to investigate north american 's problems and identify corrections phillips documented his findings in a december 19 letter to naa president lee atwood , with a strongly worded letter by mueller , and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamans meanwhile , grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module , eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 , not long after the first manned csm flights
grissom , white , and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american , and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center a plugs out test was planned for january , which would simulate a launch countdown on lc 34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad supplied to internal power if successful , this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february 21 launch , with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled
the plugs out test began on the morning of january 27 , 1967 , and immediately was plagued with problems first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits , which delayed the sealing of the hatch then , communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown during this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , 100 oxygen atmosphere pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area , frustrating attempts to rescue the crew the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened
nasa immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of congress while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex , the review board concluded that deficiencies existed in command module design , workmanship and quality control at the insistence of nasa administrator webb , north american removed harrison storms as command module program manager webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office \( aspo \) manager joseph francis shea , replacing him with george low
to remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug type hatch cover with a quick release , outward opening door nasa discontinued the manned block i program , using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights crew members would also exclusively wear modified , fire resistant block ii space suits , and would be designated by the block ii titles , regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not
in september 1967 , mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed , and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary therefore letters were used instead of numbers the a missions were unmanned saturn v validation b was unmanned lm validation using the saturn ib c was manned csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib d was the first manned csm lm flight \( this replaced as 258 , using a single saturn v launch \) e would be a higher earth orbit csm lm flight f would be the first lunar mission , testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing \( a dress rehearsal \) and g would be the first manned landing the list of types covered follow on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings , i for lunar orbital survey missions , and j for extended stay lunar landings
the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man rating the lm and saturn v apollo 4 \( as 501 \) was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v , carrying a block i csm on november 9 , 1967 the capability of the command module 's heat shield to survive a trans lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth orbital reentry speed this was followed on april 4 , 1968 , by apollo 6 \( as 502 \) which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast the intent of this mission was to achieve trans lunar injection , followed closely by a simulated direct return abort , using the service module engine to achieve another high speed reentry the saturn v experienced pogo oscillation , a problem caused by non steady engine combustion , which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages two s ii engines shut down prematurely , but the remaining engines were able to compensate the damage to the third stage engine was more severe , preventing it from restarting for trans lunar injection mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo 4 based on the good performance of apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo 6 problems , nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men , cancelling a third unmanned test
apollo 5 \( as 204 \) was the first unmanned test flight of lm in earth orbit , launched from pad 37 on january 22 , 1968 , by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo 1 the lm engines were successfully test fired and restarted , despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing the ascent engine was fired in abort mode , known as a fire in the hole test , where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage although grumman wanted a second unmanned test , george low decided the next lm flight would be manned
apollo 8 was planned to be the d mission in december 1968 , crewed by mcdivitt , scott and schweickart , launched on a saturn v instead of two saturn ibs in the summer it had become clear that the lm would not be ready in time rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth orbiting mission , aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo 8 to orbit the moon instead , deferring the d mission to the next mission in march 1969 , and eliminating the e mission this would keep the program on track the soviet union had sent animals around the moon on september 15 , 1968 , aboard zond 5 , and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo 7 gemini veterans frank borman and james lovell , and rookie william anders captured the world 's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours , transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve , and returning safely to earth
the g mission was achieved on apollo 11 in july 1969 by an all gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong , michael collins and buzz aldrin armstrong and aldrin performed the first landing at the sea of tranquility at 20 17 40 utc on july 20 , 1969 they spent a total of 21 hours , 36 minutes on the surface , and spent 2 hours , 31 minutes outside the spacecraft , walking on the surface , taking photographs , collecting material samples , and deploying automated scientific instruments , while continuously sending black and white television back to earth the astronauts returned safely on july 24
in november 1969 , gemini veteran charles pete conrad and rookie alan l bean made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in april 1967 on the ocean of storms the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f gordon , jr conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera , but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun they made two evas totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes on one , they walked to the surveyor , photographed it , and removed some parts which they returned to earth
the contracted batch of 15 saturn vs were enough for lunar landing missions through apollo 20 nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites , with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions , along with the payload capacity of the saturn v these final missions would combine the i and j types in the 1967 list , allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface , and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle \( lrv \) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm also , the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander , with two rookies apollo 13 launched lovell , jack swigert , and fred haise in april 1970 , headed for the fra mauro formation but two days out , a liquid oxygen tank exploded , disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a life boat to return to earth another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause , which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory , and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications apollo was grounded again , for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added
about the time of the first landing in 1969 , it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre built on the ground , replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches this eliminated apollo 20 nasa 's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing , and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle by 1971 , the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19 the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f kennedy space center on merritt island , florida , george c marshall space center in huntsville , alabama , michoud assembly facility in new orleans , louisiana , and lyndon b johnson space center in houston , texas
the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth , as measured by radiometric dating techniques they range in age from about 3 2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria , to about 4 6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust as such , they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the solar system , that are largely absent on earth one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock , retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo 15 mission this anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium rich feldspar mineral anorthite , and is believed to be representative of the highland crust a geochemical component called kreep was discovered , which has no known terrestrial counterpart kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten \( see lunar magma ocean \)
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters , which is never seen on earth rocks , due to the thick atmosphere many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events some of the returned samples are of impact melt \( materials melted near an impact crater \) all samples returned from the moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events
in 2009 , nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly 170 billion this included all research and development costs the procurement of 15 saturn v rockets , 16 command service modules , 12 lunar modules , plus program support and management costs construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading , and costs for flight operations this was based on a congressional budget office report , a budgetary analysis of nasa 's new vision for space , september 2004 the space review estimated in 2010 the cost of apollo from 1959 to 1973 as 20 4 billion , or 109 billion in 2010 dollars
looking beyond the manned lunar landings , nasa investigated several post lunar applications for apollo hardware the apollo extension series \( apollo x , \) proposed up to 30 flights to earth orbit , using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter \( sla \) to house a small orbital laboratory \( workshop \) astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s ivb saturn upper stage , and grew into the apollo applications program \( aap \) the workshop was to be supplemented by apollo telescope missions , which would replace the lm 's descent stage equipment and engine with a solar telescope observatory the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly by mission
the s ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board dubbed skylab , it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space , and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a saturn v it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount , the solar telescope that would have been used on the apollo telescope missions skylab 's last crew departed the station on february 8 , 1974 , and the station itself re entered the atmosphere in 1979 , by which time it had become the oldest operational apollo saturn component
in 2008 , japan aerospace exploration agency 's selene probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo 15 lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface in 2009 , nasa 's robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter , while orbiting 50 kilometers \( 31 mi \) above the moon , began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface , and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed all of the u s flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing , with the exception of the one left during the apollo 11 mission , which was blown over during that mission 's lift off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown
the crew of apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth , and read from the creation story in the book of genesis , on christmas eve , 1968 an estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw either live or delayed the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon the mission and christmas provided an inspiring end to 1968 , which had been a troubled year for the us , marked by vietnam war protests , race riots , and the assassinations of civil rights leader martin luther king , jr , and senator robert f kennedy
the moon landing data was recorded by a special apollo tv camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast tv this resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes during the following years , a magnetic tape shortage prompted nasa to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the national archives and records administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data stan lebar , who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at westinghouse electric corporation , also worked with nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes
with a budget of 230 , 000 , the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo 11 was compiled by nafzger and assigned to lowry digital for restoration the video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy the images were from tapes in australia , the cbs news archive , and kinescope recordings made at johnson space center the restored video , remaining in black and white , contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements
european union law is a body of treaties and legislation , such as regulations and directives , which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of european union member states the three sources of european union law are primary law , secondary law and supplementary law the main sources of primary law are the treaties establishing the european union secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the treaties the legislature of the european union is principally composed of the european parliament and the council of the european union , which under the treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the treaties
european union law is applied by the courts of member states and the court of justice of the european union where the laws of member states provide for lesser rights european union law can be enforced by the courts of member states in case of european union law which should have been transposed into the laws of member states , such as directives , the european commission can take proceedings against the member state under the treaty on the functioning of the european union the european court of justice is the highest court able to interpret european union law supplementary sources of european union law include case law by the court of justice , international law and general principles of european union law
although the european union does not have a codified constitution , like every political body it has laws which constitute its basic governance structure the eu 's primary constitutional sources are the treaty on european union \( teu \) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union \( tfeu \) , which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states the treaties establish the eu 's institutions , list their powers and responsibilities , and explain the areas in which the eu can legislate with directives or regulations the european commission has the initiative to propose legislation during the ordinary legislative procedure , the council \( which are ministers from member state governments \) and the european parliament \( elected by citizens \) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass the commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce eu law the european council \( rather than the council , made up of different government ministers \) is composed of the prime ministers or executive presidents of the member states it appoints the commissioners and the board of the european central bank the european court of justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets eu law , and develops it through precedent the court can review the legality of the eu institutions' actions , in compliance with the treaties it can also decide upon claims for breach of eu laws from member states and citizens
the primary law of the eu consists mainly of the founding treaties , the core treaties being the treaty on european union \( teu \) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union \( tfeu \) the treaties contain formal and substantive provisions , which frame policies of the european union institutions and determine the division of competences between the european union and its member states the teu establishes that european union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states , as well as certain islands and overseas territories , including madeira , the canary islands and the french overseas departments european union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations , for example gibraltar and the land islands the teu allows the european council to make specific provisions for regions , as for example done for customs matters in gibraltar and saint pierre et miquelon the teu specifically excludes certain regions , for example the faroe islands , from the jurisdiction of european union law treaties apply as soon as they enter into force , unless stated otherwise , and are generally concluded for an unlimited period the teu provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply vague all eu member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation , as stated in the teu , whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the teu objectives the court of justice of the european union can interpret the treaties , but it cannot rule on their validity , which is subject to international law individuals may rely on primary law in the court of justice of the european union if the treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear , precise and unconditional
the principal treaties that form the european union began with common rules for coal and steel , and then atomic energy , but more complete and formal institutions were established through the treaty of rome 1957 and the maastricht treaty 1992 \( now tfeu \) minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single , internal market in the single european act 1986 , to further the development of a more social europe in the treaty of amsterdam 1997 , and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the eu institutions in the treaty of nice 2001 and the treaty of lisbon 2007 since its establishment , more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties , from the uk , ireland , denmark and norway in 1972 \( though norway did not end up joining \) , greece in 1979 , spain and portugal 1985 , austria , finland , norway and sweden in 1994 \( though again norway failed to join , because of lack of support in the referendum \) , the czech republic , cyprus , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia in 2004 , romania and bulgaria in 2007 and croatia in 2013 greenland signed a treaty in 1985 giving it a special status
following the nice treaty , there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the european union and make it more transparent this would have also produced a single constitutional document however , as a result of the referendum in france and the referendum in the netherlands , the 2004 treaty establishing a constitution for europe never came into force instead , the lisbon treaty was enacted its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty , but it was formally an amending treaty , and though it significantly altered the existing treaties it did not completely replace them
the european commission is the main executive body of the european union article 17 \( 1 \) of the treaty on european union states the commission should promote the general interest of the union while article 17 \( 3 \) adds that commissioners should be completely independent and not take instructions from any government under article 17 \( 2 \) , union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a commission proposal , except where the treaties provide otherwise this means that the commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure , although the council is the de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives the parliament can also formally request the commission to submit a legislative proposal but the commission can reject such a suggestion , giving reasons the commission 's president \( currently an ex luxembourg prime minister , jean claude juncker \) sets the agenda for the eu 's work decisions are taken by a simple majority vote , usually through a written procedure of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections citation needed since ireland refused to consent to changes in the treaty of lisbon 2007 , there remains one commissioner for each of the 28 member states , including the president and the high representative for foreign and security policy \( currently federica mogherini \) the commissioners \( and most importantly , the portfolios they will hold \) are bargained over intensively by the member states the commissioners , as a block , are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the council to approve , and majority approval of the parliament the proposal to make the commissioners be drawn from the elected parliament , was not adopted in the treaty of lisbon this means commissioners are , through the appointment process , the unelected subordinates of member state governments
commissioners have various privileges , such as being exempt from member state taxes \( but not eu taxes \) , and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the santer commission was censured by parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations this resulted in one main case , commission v edith cresson where the european court of justice held that a commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law by contrast to the ecj 's relaxed approach , a committee of independent experts found that a culture had developed where few commissioners had even the slightest sense of responsibility this led to the creation of the european anti fraud office in 2012 it investigated the maltese commissioner for health , john dalli , who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a 60m bribe in connection with a tobacco products directive beyond the commission , the european central bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro it has a six person board appointed by the european council , on the council 's recommendation the president of the council and a commissioner can sit in on ecb meetings , but do not have voting rights
while the commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation , the european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process according to the treaty on european union articles 9 and 10 , the eu observes the principle of equality of its citizens and is meant to be founded on representative democracy in practice , equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament cannot initiate legislation against the commission 's wishes , citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries , and qualified majorities or consensus of the council are required to legislate the justification for this democratic deficit under the treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the european economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts , while popular understanding of the eu developed and nationalist sentiments declined post war over time , this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice from being an unelected assembly , to its first direct elections in 1979 , to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all european member states under teu article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the commission with one million signatures tfeu article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the parliament on issues which affect them parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote there are 750 meps and their numbers are degressively proportional according to member state size this means although the council is meant to be the body representing member states in the parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states meps divide , as they do in national parliaments , along political party lines the conservative european people 's party is currently the largest , and the party of european socialists leads the opposition parties do not receive public funds from the eu , as the court of justice held in parti cologiste les verts v parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states the parliament 's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an ombudsman pending any court proceedings it can require the commission respond to questions and by a two thirds majority can censure the whole commission \( as happened to the santer commission in 1999 \) in some cases , the parliament has explicit consultation rights , which the commission must genuinely follow however its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the commission and council , meaning power \( kratia \) is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people \( demos \) in the eu it is not yet true that the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few
the second main legislative body is the council , which is composed of different ministers of the member states the heads of government of member states also convene a european council \( a distinct body \) that the teu article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities' it meets each six months and its president \( currently former poland prime minister donald tusk \) is meant to 'drive forward its work' , but it does not itself 'legislative functions' the council does this in effect this is the governments of the member states , but there will be a different minister at each meeting , depending on the topic discussed \( e g for environmental issues , the member states' environment ministers attend and vote for foreign affairs , the foreign ministers , etc \) the minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions when voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size , so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states in total there are 352 votes , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , if not consensus teu article 16 \( 4 \) and tfeu article 238 \( 3 \) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the council members \( not votes \) representing 65 per cent of the population of the eu currently this means around 74 per cent , or 260 of the 352 votes this is critical during the legislative process
to make new legislation , tfeu article 294 defines the ordinary legislative procedure that applies for most eu acts the essence is there are three readings , starting with a commission proposal , where the parliament must vote by a majority of all meps \( not just those present \) to block or suggest changes , and the council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block commission amendment where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage , a conciliation committee is convened , representing meps , ministers and the commission to try and get agreement on a joint text if this works , it will be sent back to the parliament and council to approve by absolute and qualified majority this means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in parliament , a minority in the council , and a majority in the commission it is harder to change eu law than stay the same a different procedure exists for budgets for enhanced cooperation among a sub set of at least member states , authorisation must be given by the council member state governments should be informed by the commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure the eu as a whole can only act within its power set out in the treaties teu articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the kompetenz kompetenz question who ultimately has the competence to define the eu 's competence many member state courts believe they decide , other member state parliaments believe they decide , while within the eu , the court of justice believes it has the final say
the judicial branch of the eu has played an important role in the development of eu law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration today the court of justice of the european union \( cjeu \) is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher european court of justice \( commonly abbreviated as ecj \) that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a general court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance there is also a civil service tribunal to deal with eu staff issues , and then a separate court of auditors under the treaty on european union article 19 \( 2 \) there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices \( or for the general court , the ability required for appointment to high judicial office \) a president is elected by the judges for three years under teu article 19 \( 3 \) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of eu law in fact , most eu law is applied by member state courts \( the english court of appeal , the german bundesgerichtshof , the belgian cour du travail , etc \) but they can refer questions to the eu court for a preliminary ruling the cjeu 's duty is to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments , including van gend en loos , mangold v helm , and kadi v commission
since its founding , the eu has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems within the eu itself , the court of justice 's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law , then eu law has primacy in the first major case in 1964 , costa v enel , a milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations he claimed the italian nationalisation law conflicted with the treaty of rome , and requested a reference be made to both the italian constitutional court and the court of justice under tfeu article 267 the italian constitutional court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , costa had no claim by contrast , the court of justice held that ultimately the treaty of rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the treaty provisions only the commission could have brought a claim , not mr costa however , in principle , mr costa was entitled to plead that the treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision the court of justice , repeating its view in van gend en loos , said member states albeit within limited spheres , have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves on the basis of reciprocity eu law would not be overridden by domestic legal provisions , however framed without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question this meant any subsequent unilateral act of the member state inapplicable similarly , in amministrazione delle finanze v simmenthal spa , a company , simmenthal spa , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an italian law of 1970 for importing beef from france to italy was contrary to two regulations from 1964 and 1968 in accordance with the principle of the precedence of community law , said the court of justice , the directly applicable measures of the institutions \( such as the regulations in the case \) render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law this was necessary to prevent a corresponding denial of treaty obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states , that could imperil the very foundations of the eu but despite the views of the court of justice , the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis
generally speaking , while all member states recognise that eu law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the treaties , they do not accept that the court of justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights in the united kingdom , the basic principle is that parliament , as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy , can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against eu law this , however , would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the eu it was held in r \( factortame ltd \) v secretary of state for transport that whatever limitation of its sovereignty parliament accepted when it enacted the european communities act 1972 was entirely voluntary and so it has always been clear that uk courts have a duty to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of community law more recently the uk supreme court noted that in r \( hs2 action alliance ltd \) v secretary of state for transport , although the uk constitution is uncodified , there could be fundamental principles of common law , and parliament did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation of those principles when it enacted the european communities act 1972 the view of the german constitutional court from the solange i and solange ii decisions is that if the eu does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles \( particularly democracy , the rule of law and the social state principles \) then it cannot override german law however , as the nicknames of the judgments go , so long as the eu works towards the democratisation of its institutions , and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights , it would not review eu legislation for compatibility with german constitutional principles most other member states have expressed similar reservations this suggests the eu 's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states , its factual commitment to human rights , and the democratic will of the people
while constitutional law concerns the european union 's governance structure , administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law both member states and the commission have a general legal right or standing \( locus standi \) to bring claims against eu institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties from the eu 's foundation , the court of justice also held that the treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against eu and member state institutions for violation of the treaties and regulations , if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations however , under directives , citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non state parties this meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an eu law where a national rule conflicted , even though the member state government could be sued , if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation these rules on direct effect limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer eu law all actions by eu institutions can be subject to judicial review , and judged by standards of proportionality , particularly where general principles of law , or fundamental rights are engaged the remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages , but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction , in order to ensure the law is effective as possible
although it is generally accepted that eu law has primacy , not all eu laws give citizens standing to bring claims that is , not all eu laws have direct effect in van gend en loos v nederlandse administratie der belastingen it was held that the provisions of the treaties \( and eu regulations \) are directly effective , if they are \( 1 \) clear and unambiguous \( 2 \) unconditional , and \( 3 \) did not require eu or national authorities to take further action to implement them van gend en loos , a postal company , claimed that what is now tfeu article 30 prevented the dutch customs authorities charging tariffs , when it imported urea formaldehyde plastics from germany to the netherlands after a dutch court made a reference , the court of justice held that even though the treaties did not expressly confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims , they could do so historically , international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement , but the court of justice proclaimed the community constitutes a new legal order of international law because article 30 clearly , unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade , without a good justification , van gend en loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff eu regulations are the same as treaty provisions in this sense , because as tfeu article 288 states , they are directly applicable in all member states moreover , member states comes under a duty not to replicate regulations in their own law , in order to prevent confusion for instance , in commission v italy the court of justice held that italy had breached a duty under the treaties , both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows \( to reduce dairy overproduction \) , and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions regulations , held the court of justice , come into force solely by virtue of their publication and implementation could have the effect of jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the union on the other hand , some regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures , in which case those specific rules should be followed
while the treaties and regulations will have direct effect \( if clear , unconditional and immediate \) , directives do not generally give citizens \( as opposed to the member state \) standing to sue other citizens in theory , this is because tfeu article 288 says directives are addressed to the member states and usually leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods to implement in part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards , leaving member states to apply higher standards for example , the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law however , on the current position adopted by the court of justice , citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement directives , but not from directives themselves directives do not have so called horizontal direct effect \( i e between non state parties \) this view was instantly controversial , and in the early 1990s three advocate generals persuasively argued that directives should create rights and duties for all citizens the court of justice refused , but there are five large exceptions
first , if a directive 's deadline for implementation is not met , the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws , and a citizen may rely on the directive in such an action \( so called vertical direct effect \) so , in pubblico ministero v ratti because the italian government had failed to implement a directive 73 173 eec on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline , it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against mr ratti 's solvent and varnish business a member state could not rely , as against individuals , on its own failure to perform the obligations which the directive entails second , a citizen or company can invoke a directive , not just in a dispute with a public authority , but in a dispute with another citizen or company so , in cia security v signalson and securitel the court of justice held that a business called cia security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems , on the basis that it had not been notified to the commission as a directive required third , if a directive gives expression to a general principle of eu law , it can be invoked between private non state parties before its deadline for implementation this follows from k c kdeveci v swedex gmbh co kg where the german civil code 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal ms k c kdeveci worked for 10 years , from age 18 to 28 , for swedex gmbh co kg before her dismissal she claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the employment equality framework directive the court of justice held that the directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of eu law third , if the defendant is an emanation of the state , even if not central government , it can still be bound by directives in foster v british gas plc the court of justice held that mrs foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer , british gas plc , which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65 , if \( 1 \) pursuant to a state measure , \( 2 \) it provided a public service , and \( 3 \) had special powers this could also be true if the enterprise is privatised , as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision
fourth , national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive textbooks \( though not the court itself \) often called this indirect effect in marleasing sa v la comercial sa the court of justice held that a spanish court had to interpret its general civil code provisions , on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors , to conform with the first company law directive article 11 , that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons the court of justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute but , fifth , if a member state has failed to implement a directive , a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non state parties , but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law so , in francovich v italy , the italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent , as the insolvency protection directive required francovich , the former employee of a bankrupt venetian firm , was therefore allowed to claim 6 million lira from the italian government in damages for his loss the court of justice held that if a directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals , and there is a causal link between a member state 's violation of eu and a claimant 's loss , damages must be paid the fact that the incompatible law is an act of parliament is no defence
the principles of european union law are rules of law which have been developed by the european court of justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how european union law is interpreted and applies in formulating these principles , the courts have drawn on a variety of sources , including public international law and legal doctrines and principles present in the legal systems of european union member states and in the jurisprudence of the european court of human rights accepted general principles of european union law include fundamental rights \( see human rights \) , proportionality , legal certainty , equality before the law and subsidiarity
proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1950s according to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued when there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted , and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued the principle of proportionality is also recognised in article 5 of the ec treaty , stating that any action by the community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this treaty
the concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1960s it is an important general principle of international law and public law , which predates european union law as a general principle in european union law it means that the law must be certain , in that it is clear and precise , and its legal implications foreseeable , specially when applied to financial obligations the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the european union must have a proper legal basis legislation in member states which implements european union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law in european union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits ex post facto laws , i e laws should not take effect before they are published the doctrine of legitimate expectation , which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith , is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in european union law the legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations
fundamental rights , as in human rights , were first recognised by the european court of justice in the late 60s and fundamental rights are now regarded as integral part of the general principles of european union law as such the european court of justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states therefore , the european court of justice cannot uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states the european court of justice also found that international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the member states have collaborated or of which they are signatories , can supply guidelines which should be followed within the framework of community law
none of the original treaties establishing the european union mention protection for fundamental rights it was not envisaged for european union measures , that is legislative and administrative actions by european union institutions , to be subject to human rights at the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights , hence the establishment of the european convention on human rights in 1950 and the establishment of the european court of human rights the european court of justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of european union law as the need to ensure that european union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent in 1999 the european council set up a body tasked with drafting a european charter of human rights , which could form the constitutional basis for the european union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the european union and its institutions the charter of fundamental rights of the european union draws a list of fundamental rights from the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms , the declaration on fundamental rights produced by the european parliament in 1989 and european union treaties
the 2007 lisbon treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in article 6 \( 1 \) that the union recognises the rights , freedoms and principles set out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union of 7 december 2000 , as adopted at strasbourg on 12 december 2007 , which shall have the same legal value as the treaties therefore , the charter of fundamental rights of the european union has become an integral part of european union law , codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of european union law in effect , after the lisbon treaty , the charter and the convention now co exist under european union law , though the former is enforced by the european court of justice in relation to european union measures , and the latter by the european court of human rights in relation to measures by member states
the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law the basis for the social chapter was developed in 1989 by the social partners representatives , namely unice , the employers' confederation , the european trade union confederation \( etuc \) and ceep , the european centre of public enterprises a toned down version was adopted as the social charter at the 1989 strasbourg european council the social charter declares 30 general principles , including on fair remuneration of employment , health and safety at work , rights of disabled and elderly , the rights of workers , on vocational training and improvements of living conditions the social charter became the basis for european community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation
the social charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states the uk refused to sign the social charter and was exempt from the legislation covering social charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation the uk subsequently was the only member state to veto the social charter being included as the social chapter of the 1992 maastricht treaty instead , an agreement on social policy was added as a protocol again , the uk was exempt from legislation arising from the protocol , unless it agreed to be bound by it the protocol was to become known as social chapter , despite not actually being a chapter of the maastricht treaty to achieve aims of the agreement on social policy the european union was to support and complement the policies of member states the aims of the agreement on social policy are
following the election of the uk labour party to government in 1997 , the uk formally subscribed to the agreement on social policy , which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the social chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam the uk subsequently adopted the main legislation previously agreed under the agreement on social policy , the 1994 works council directive , which required workforce consultation in businesses , and the 1996 parental leave directive in the 10 years following the 1997 treaty of amsterdam and adoption of the social chapter the european union has undertaken policy initiatives in various social policy areas , including labour and industry relations , equal opportunity , health and safety , public health , protection of children , the disabled and elderly , poverty , migrant workers , education , training and youth
eu competition law has its origins in the european coal and steel community \( ecsc \) agreement between france , italy , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and germany in 1951 following the second world war the agreement aimed to prevent germany from re establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations , or mergers , and the abuse of a dominant position by companies this was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans european model of competition law in 1957 competition rules were included in the treaty of rome , also known as the ec treaty , which established the european economic community \( eec \) the treaty of rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the eec through the institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted the two central provisions on eu competition law on companies were established in article 85 , which prohibited anti competitive agreements , subject to some exemptions , and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position the treaty also established principles on competition law for member states , with article 90 covering public undertakings , and article 92 making provisions on state aid regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time
today , the treaty of lisbon prohibits anti competitive agreements in article 101 \( 1 \) , including price fixing according to article 101 \( 2 \) any such agreements are automatically void article 101 \( 3 \) establishes exemptions , if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation , gives consumers a fair share of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere \( or compliant with the general principle of european union law of proportionality \) article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position , such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing article 102 allows the european council to regulations to govern mergers between firms \( the current regulation is the regulation 139 2004 ec \) the general test is whether a concentration \( i e merger or acquisition \) with a community dimension \( i e affects a number of eu member states \) might significantly impede effective competition articles 106 and 107 provide that member state 's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed , but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities , regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster
while the concept of a social market economy was only introduced into eu law in 2007 , free movement and trade were central to european development since the treaty of rome 1957 according to the standard theory of comparative advantage , two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects like in other regional organisations such as the north american free trade association , or the world trade organisation , breaking down barriers to trade , and enhancing free movement of goods , services , labour and capital , is meant to reduce consumer prices it was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union , which led to a common market , then monetary union , then union of monetary and fiscal policy , political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state in europe , however , those stages were considerably mixed , and it remains unclear whether the endgame should be the same as a state , traditionally understood in practice free trade , without standards to ensure fair trade , can benefit some people and groups within countries \( particularly big business \) much more than others , but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market , particularly workers , consumers , small business , developing industries , and communities the treaty on the functioning of the european union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the eu , while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons , services and capital these so called four freedoms were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers \( e g customs \) , technical barriers \( e g differing laws on safety , consumer or environmental standards \) and fiscal barriers \( e g different value added tax rates \) the tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit the treaties limit free trade , to prioritise other values such as public health , consumer protection , labour rights , fair competition , and environmental improvement increasingly the court of justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people 's well being
free movement of goods within the european union is achieved by a customs union , and the principle of non discrimination the eu manages imports from non member states , duties between member states are prohibited , and imports circulate freely in addition under the treaty on the functioning of the european union article 34 , quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between member states in procureur du roi v dassonville the court of justice held that this rule meant all trading rules that are enacted by member states which could hinder trade directly or indirectly , actually or potentially would be caught by article 34 this meant that a belgian law requiring scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful it discriminated against parallel importers like mr dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in france , where they bought the scotch this wide test , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi government bodies , such as the former buy irish company that had government appointees it also means states can be responsible for private actors for instance , in commission v france french farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of spanish strawberries , and even belgian tomato imports france was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage generally speaking , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports \( or exports under tfeu article 35 \) then it must be justified under article 36 the justifications include public morality , policy or security , protection of health and life of humans , animals or plants , national treasures of artistic , historic or archaeological value and industrial and commercial property in addition , although not clearly listed , environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from tfeu article 11 more generally , it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules so , in schmidberger v austria the court of justice held that austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the a13 , brenner autobahn , en route to italy although many companies , including mr schmidberger 's german undertaking , were prevented from trading , the court of justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the fundamental pillars of a democratic society , against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced , and was probably subordinate if a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification , the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately this means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and \( 1 \) be suitable to achieve the aim , \( 2 \) be necessary , so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result , and \( 3 \) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36
often rules apply to all goods neutrally , but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products for such indirect discriminatory \( or indistinctly applicable \) measures the court of justice has developed more justifications either those in article 36 , or additional mandatory or overriding requirements such as consumer protection , improving labour standards , protecting the environment , press diversity , fairness in commerce , and more the categories are not closed in the most famous case rewe zentral ag v bundesmonopol f r branntwein , the court of justice found that a german law requiring all spirits and liqueurs \( not just imported ones \) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to tfeu article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports german liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but cassis de dijon , which rewe zentrale ag wished to import from france , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol the court of justice rejected the german government 's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under tfeu article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought this rule primarily applies to requirements about a product 's content or packaging in walter rau lebensmittelwerke v de smedt pvba the court of justice found that a belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection the argument that belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate it would considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view and labelling would protect consumers just as effectively in a 2003 case , commission v italy italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as chocolate it had to be chocolate substitute all italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , but british , danish and irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats they claimed the law infringed article 34 the court of justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a chocolate substitute label this was derogatory in the consumers' eyes a neutral and objective statement was enough to protect consumers if member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product , this can also infringe article 34 so , in a 2009 case , commission v italy , the court of justice held that an italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 again , the law applied neutrally to everyone , but disproportionately affected importers , because italian companies did not make trailers this was not a product requirement , but the court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it it would have a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers that affects the access of that product to the market it would require justification under article 36 , or as a mandatory requirement
in contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access , the court of justice developed a presumption that selling arrangements would be presumed to not fall into tfeu article 34 , if they applied equally to all sellers , and affected them in the same manner in fact in keck and mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a french competition law , which prevented them selling picon beer under wholesale price , was unlawful the aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition , not to hinder trade the court of justice held , as in law and in fact it was an equally applicable selling arrangement \( not something that alters a product 's content \) it was outside the scope of article 34 , and so did not need to be justified selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect in fact particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market , but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing in konsumentombudsmannen v de agostini the court of justice reviewed swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 , and misleading commercials for skin care products while the bans have remained \( justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement \) the court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were the only effective form of promotion enabling a trader to penetrate the market in konsumentombudsmannen v gourmet ab the court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio , tv and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' traditional social practices and to local habits and customs to buy their products , but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health under the unfair commercial practices directive , the eu harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising , to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour , is misleading or aggressive , and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair increasingly , states have to give mutual recognition to each other 's standards of regulation , while the eu has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice the attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory race to the bottom , while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent
since its foundation , the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement reflecting the economic nature of the project , the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers as a factor of production however , from the 1970s , this focus shifted towards developing a more social europe free movement was increasingly based on citizenship , so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active , rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights this means the basic worker rights in tfeu article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in tfeu articles 18 to 21 according to the court of justice , a worker is anybody who is economically active , which includes everyone in an employment relationship , under the direction of another person for remuneration a job , however , need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker for example , in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie , a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands , while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community , which provided for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an indirect quid pro quo for the work he did having worker status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments , and employers , in access to employment , tax , and social security rights by contrast a citizen , who is any person having the nationality of a member state \( tfeu article 20 \( 1 \) \) , has rights to seek work , vote in local and european elections , but more restricted rights to claim social security in practice , free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people 's jobs and benefits \( paradoxically at the same time \) nevertheless , practically all available research finds little impact of labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers
the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers first , articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment , conclude contracts , and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state in a famous case , the belgian football association v bosman , a belgian footballer named jean marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from r f c de li ge to usl dunkerque when his contract finished , regardless of whether dunkerque could afford to pay li ge the habitual transfer fees the court of justice held the transfer rules constitute d an obstacle to free movement and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest , but this was unlikely in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language , but only if the measure was not disproportionate by contrast in angonese v cassa di risparmio di bolzano spa a bank in bolzano , italy , was not allowed to require mr angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in bolzano the court of justice , giving horizontal direct effect to tfeu article 45 , reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate , and because it was impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means , the measure was disproportionate second , article 7 \( 2 \) requires equal treatment in respect of tax in finanzamt k ln altstadt v schumacker the court of justice held that it contravened tfeu art 45 to deny tax benefits \( e g for married couples , and social insurance expense deductions \) to a man who worked in germany , but was resident in belgium when other german residents got the benefits by contrast in weigel v finanzlandesdirektion f r vorarlberg the court of justice rejected mr weigel 's claim that a re registration charge upon bringing his car to austria violated his right to free movement although the tax was likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement , because the charge applied equally to austrians , in absence of eu legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified third , people must receive equal treatment regarding social advantages , although the court has approved residential qualifying periods in hendrix v employee insurance institute the court of justice held that a dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to belgium , because the benefit was closely linked to the socio economic situation of the netherlands conversely , in geven v land nordrhein westfalen the court of justice held that a dutch woman living in the netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in germany , did not have a right to receive german child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full time in germany but was resident in austria could the general justifications for limiting free movement in tfeu article 45 \( 3 \) are public policy , public security or public health , and there is also a general exception in article 45 \( 4 \) for employment in the public service
citizenship of the eu has increasingly been seen as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the court of justice , and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move the court has required that higher education , along with other forms of vocational training , should be more access , albeit with qualifying periods in commission v austria the court held that austria was not entitled to restrict places in austrian universities to austrian students to avoid structural , staffing and financial problems if \( mainly german \) foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem
as well as creating rights for workers who generally lack bargaining power in the market , the treaty on the functioning of the european union also protects the freedom of establishment in article 49 , and freedom to provide services in article 56 in gebhard v consiglio dell ordine degli avvocati e procuratori di milano the court of justice held that to be established means to participate in economic life on a stable and continuous basis , while providing services meant pursuing activity more on a temporary basis this meant that a lawyer from stuttgart , who had set up chambers in milan and was censured by the milan bar council for not having registered , was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom , rather than service freedom however , the requirements to be registered in milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non discriminatory , justified by imperative requirements in the general interest and proportionately applied all people or entities that engage in economic activity , particularly the self employed , or undertakings such as companies or firms , have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions the court of justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment , so article 49 has both vertical and horizontal direct effect in reyners v belgium the court of justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the belgian bar because he lacked belgian nationality was unjustified tfeu article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise official authority , but this did an advocate 's work \( as opposed to a court 's \) was not official by contrast in commission v italy the court of justice held that a requirement for lawyers in italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction the grand chamber of the court of justice held the commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market therefore , there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified
in 2006 , a toxic waste spill off the coast of c te d'ivoire , from a european ship , prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste environment commissioner stavros dimas stated that such highly toxic waste should never have left the european union with countries such as spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste , franco frattini , the justice , freedom and security commissioner , proposed with dimas to create criminal sentences for ecological crimes the competence for the union to do this was contested in 2005 at the court of justice resulting in a victory for the commission that ruling set a precedent that the commission , on a supranational basis , may legislate in criminal law something never done before so far , the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive motions were tabled in the european parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an eu competence , but was rejected at vote however , in october 2007 , the court of justice ruled that the commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be , only that there must be some
the freedom to provide services under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services for remuneration , especially commercial or professional activity for example , in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice the court of justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice the court of justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not health care generally counts as a service in geraets smits v stichting ziekenfonds mrs geraets smits claimed she should be reimbursed by dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in germany the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom \( of the german health clinic \) to provide services several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , and should not fall within article 56 but the court of justice held health was a service even though the government \( rather than the service recipient \) paid for the service national authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay , and it followed international medical science on which treatments counted as normal and necessary the court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , and this is also true in the context of the uk 's national health service aside from public services , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal josemans v burgemeester van maastricht held that the netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists \( but not dutch nationals \) going to coffee shops , fell outside article 56 altogether the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi legal activity was subject to restriction if an activity does fall within article 56 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the court of justice in alpine investments bv v minister van financi n a business that sold commodities futures \( with merrill lynch and another banking firms \) attempted to challenge a dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers the court of justice held the dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent undesirable developments in securities trading including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence in the dutch markets in omega spielhallen gmbh v bonn a laserdrome business was banned by the bonn council it bought fake laser gun services from a uk firm called pulsar ltd , but residents had protested against playing at killing entertainment the court of justice held that the german constitutional value of human dignity , which underpinned the ban , did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services in liga portuguesa de futebol v santa casa da miseric rdia de lisboa the court of justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people 's views were highly divergent the ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet in the services directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed
in regard to companies , the court of justice held in r \( daily mail and general trust plc \) v hm treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing tfeu article 49 this meant the daily mail newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the uk the uk did not need to justify its action , as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised by contrast , in centros ltd v erhversus og selkabssyrelsen the court of justice found that a uk limited company operating in denmark could not be required to comply with denmark 's minimum share capital rules uk law only required 1 of capital to start a company , while denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200 , 000 danish krone \( around 27 , 000 \) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent the court of justice held that denmark 's minimum capital law infringed centros ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , because a company in the uk could admittedly provide services in denmark without being established there , and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection this approach was criticised as potentially opening the eu to unjustified regulatory competition , and a race to the bottom in standards , like in the us where the state delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result similarly in berseering bv v nordic construction gmbh the court of justice held that a german court could not deny a dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in germany although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far it was an outright negation of the right of establishment however , in cartesio oktat s szolg ltat bt the court of justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law , they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose this meant that the hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to italy while it still operated and was incorporated in hungary thus , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies \( where restrictions must be justified \) , and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory , although it is not entirely clear why
the amazon rainforest \( portuguese floresta amaz nica or amaz nia spanish selva amaz nica , amazon a or usually amazonia french for t amazonienne dutch amazoneregenwoud \) , also known in english as amazonia or the amazon jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the amazon basin of south america this basin encompasses 7 , 000 , 000 square kilometres \( 2 , 700 , 000 sq mi \) , of which 5 , 500 , 000 square kilometres \( 2 , 100 , 000 sq mi \) are covered by the rainforest this region includes territory belonging to nine nations the majority of the forest is contained within brazil , with 60 of the rainforest , followed by peru with 13 , colombia with 10 , and with minor amounts in venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , guyana , suriname and french guiana states or departments in four nations contain amazonas in their names the amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world , with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16 , 000 species
following the cretaceous paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent from 66 34 mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45 climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics during the oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band it expanded again during the middle miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum however , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species
during the mid eocene , it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch water on the eastern side flowed toward the atlantic , while to the west water flowed toward the pacific across the amazonas basin as the andes mountains rose , however , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake now known as the solim es basin within the last 5 10 million years , this accumulating water broke through the purus arch , joining the easterly flow toward the atlantic
there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21 , 000 years through the last glacial maximum \( lgm \) and subsequent deglaciation analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin there is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data
nasa 's calipso satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the sahara to the amazon an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the sahara each year , at 15 degrees west longitude , across 1 , 600 miles \( 2 , 600 km \) over the atlantic ocean \( some dust falls into the atlantic \) , then at 35 degrees west longitude at the eastern coast of south america , 27 7 million tons \( 15 \) of dust fall over the amazon basin , 132 million tons of dust remain in the air , 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the caribbean sea , past 75 degrees west longitude
for a long time , it was thought that the amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea , as described in her book amazonia man and culture in a counterfeit paradise she claimed that a population density of 0 2 inhabitants per square kilometre \( 0 52 sq mi \) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population however , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at maraj , and inland dwellers by 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200 , 000
the first european to travel the length of the amazon river was francisco de orellana in 1542 the bbc 's unnatural histories presents evidence that orellana , rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought , was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the amazon in the 1540s it is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from europe , such as smallpox since the 1970s , numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between ad 0 1250 , furthering claims about pre columbian civilizations ondemar dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and alceu ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over acre the bbc 's unnatural histories presented evidence that the amazon rainforest , rather than being a pristine wilderness , has been shaped by man for at least 11 , 000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta
terra preta \( black earth \) , which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management , rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed in the region of the xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida among those were evidence of roads , bridges and large plazas
the region is home to about 2 5 million insect species , tens of thousands of plants , and some 2 , 000 birds and mammals to date , at least 40 , 000 plant species , 2 , 200 fishes , 1 , 294 birds , 427 mammals , 428 amphibians , and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region one in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the amazon , and one in five of the fish species live in amazonian rivers and streams scientists have described between 96 , 660 and 128 , 843 invertebrate species in brazil alone
the biodiversity of plant species is the highest on earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer \( 62 acres \) of ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1 , 100 tree species a study in 1999 found one square kilometer \( 247 acres \) of amazon rainforest can contain about 90 , 790 tonnes of living plants the average plant biomass is estimated at 356 47 tonnes per hectare to date , an estimated 438 , 000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued the total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16 , 000
the rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman , jaguar , cougar , and anaconda in the river , electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill , while piranha are known to bite and injure humans various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh there are also numerous parasites and disease vectors vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus malaria , yellow fever and dengue fever can also be contracted in the amazon region
deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non forested areas the main sources of deforestation in the amazon are human settlement and development of the land prior to the early 1960s , access to the forest 's interior was highly restricted , and the forest remained basically intact farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method however , the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion the soils in the amazon are productive for just a short period of time , so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land these farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage deforestation is considerable , and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space
between 1991 and 2000 , the total area of forest lost in the amazon rose from 415 , 000 to 587 , 000 square kilometres \( 160 , 000 to 227 , 000 sq mi \) , with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle seventy percent of formerly forested land in the amazon , and 91 of land deforested since 1970 , is used for livestock pasture currently , brazil is the second largest global producer of soybeans after the united states new research however , conducted by leydimere oliveira et al , has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the amazon , the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes so despite the popular perception , there has been no economical advantage for brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields
the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 \( 22 , 392 km2 or 8 , 646 sq mi per year \) was 18 higher than in the previous five years \( 19 , 018 km2 or 7 , 343 sq mi per year \) although deforestation has declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014 , there has been an increase to the present day
environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest , and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation , which could accelerate global warming amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10 of the world 's terrestrial primary productivity and 10 of the carbon stores in ecosystems of the order of 1 1 1011 metric tonnes of carbon amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0 62 0 37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996
one computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures , leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100 however , simulations of amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response , ranging from weak increases to strong decreases the result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation
as indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide , such as in the peruvian amazon indigenous peoples' rainforest communities continue to disappear , while others , like the urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories meanwhile , the relationship between non human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland south american peoples has gained increased attention , as have ethno biology and community based conservation efforts
the use of remote sensing for the conservation of the amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests using handheld gps devices and programs like google earth , members of the trio tribe , who live in the rainforests of southern suriname , map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims currently , most tribes in the amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries , making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories
to accurately map the amazon 's biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions , the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial in 2006 tatiana kuplich organized the trees of the amazon into four categories \( 1 \) mature forest , \( 2 \) regenerating forest less than three years , \( 3 \) regenerating forest between three and five years of regrowth , and \( 4 \) regenerating forest eleven to eighteen years of continued development the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar \( sar \) and thematic mapper \( tm \) to accurately place the different portions of the amazon into one of the four classifications
in 2005 , parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years , and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought a july 23 , 2006 article in the uk newspaper the independent reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response , coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate , are pushing the rainforest towards a tipping point where it would irreversibly start to die it concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert , with catastrophic consequences for the world 's climate
in 2010 the amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought , in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought the affected region was approximate 1 , 160 , 000 square miles \( 3 , 000 , 000 km2 \) of rainforest , compared to 734 , 000 square miles \( 1 , 900 , 000 km2 \) in 2005 the 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off , whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part the findings were published in the journal science in a typical year the amazon absorbs 1 5 gigatons of carbon dioxide during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released
ctenophora \( t n f r singular ctenophore , t n f r or ti n f r from the greek kteis 'comb' and pher 'carry' commonly known as comb jellies \) is a phylum of animals that live in marine waters worldwide their most distinctive feature is the combs groups of cilia which they use for swimming they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1 5 m \( 4 ft 11 in \) in size like cnidarians , their bodies consist of a mass of jelly , with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity in ctenophores , these layers are two cells deep , while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum , coelenterata , as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla
almost all ctenophores are predators , taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans the exceptions are juveniles of two species , which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed in favorable circumstances , ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day only 100 150 species have been validated , and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named the textbook examples are cydippids with egg shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla \( little tentacles \) that are covered with colloblasts , sticky cells that capture prey the phylum has a wide range of body forms , including the flattened , deep sea platyctenids , in which the adults of most species lack combs , and the coastal beroids , which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large , stiffened cilia that act as teeth these variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area , because they specialize in different types of prey , which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use
most species are hermaphrodites a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm , meaning it can fertilize its own egg , not needing a mate some are simultaneous hermaphrodites , which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time others are sequential hermaphrodites , in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times fertilization is generally external , although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch the young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids , gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow the exceptions are the beroids , whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles , and the platyctenids , whose young live as cydippid like plankton until they reach near adult size , but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form in at least some species , juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape the combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate
ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations , but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find in bays where they occur in very high numbers , predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods , which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton \( planktonic plants \) , which are a vital part of marine food chains one ctenophore , mnemiopsis , has accidentally been introduced into the black sea , where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish the situation was aggravated by other factors , such as over fishing and long term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the mnemiopsis population the later accidental introduction of beroe helped to mitigate the problem , as beroe preys on other ctenophores
despite their soft , gelatinous bodies , fossils thought to represent ctenophores , apparently with no tentacles but many more comb rows than modern forms , have been found in lagerst tten as far back as the early cambrian , about 515 million years ago the position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated , and the majority view at present , based on molecular phylogenetics , is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid like , and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently , probably after the cretaceous paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor , because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids
ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges , about as complex as cnidarians \( jellyfish , sea anemones , etc \) , and less complex than bilaterians \( which include almost all other animals \) unlike sponges , both ctenophores and cnidarians have cells bound by inter cell connections and carpet like basement membranes muscles nervous systems and some have sensory organs ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts , which are sticky and adhere to prey , although a few ctenophore species lack them
like sponges and cnidarians , ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly like material , which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly like layer hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic , along with sponges both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that , in more complex animals , arises from the middle cell layer , and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic , while others still regard them as diploblastic
ranging from about 1 millimeter \( 0 039 in \) to 1 5 meters \( 4 9 ft \) in size , ctenophores are the largest non colonial animals that use cilia \( hairs \) as their main method of locomotion most species have eight strips , called comb rows , that run the length of their bodies and bear comb like bands of cilia , called ctenes , stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat , those of each comb touch the comb below the name ctenophora means comb bearing , from the greek \( stem form \) meaning comb and the greek suffix meaning carrying
for a phylum with relatively few species , ctenophores have a wide range of body plans coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study in addition oceanic species do not preserve well , and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera pleurobrachia , beroe and mnemiopsis at least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid pleurobrachia
the internal cavity forms a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles a pharynx \( throat \) a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach and a system of internal canals these branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal the mouth and pharynx the roots of the tentacles , if present all along the underside of each comb row and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth two of these four branches terminate in anal pores the inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium , the gastrodermis the mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well developed muscles in other parts of the canal system , the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies the nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles \( internal compartments \) , germ cells that produce eggs or sperm , and photocytes that produce bioluminescence the side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals , punctuated by ciliary rosettes , pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea
the outer surface bears usually eight comb rows , called swimming plates , which are used for swimming the rows are oriented to run from near the mouth \( the oral pole \) to the opposite end \( the aboral pole \) , and are spaced more or less evenly around the body , although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth the combs \( also called ctenes or comb plates \) run across each row , and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters \( 0 079 in \) unlike conventional cilia and flagella , which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 2 pattern , these cilia are arranged in a 9 3 pattern , where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function these normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth , although they can also reverse direction hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing , unlike jellyfish when trying to escape predators , one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior , by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia
it is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy , but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater if they enter less dense brackish water , the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density , to avoid sinking conversely if they move from brackish to full strength seawater , the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density
the largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ \( at the opposite end from the mouth \) its main component is a statocyst , a balance sensor consisting of a statolith , a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia , called balancers , that sense its orientation the statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long , immobile cilia a ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers instead its response is determined by the animal 's mood , in other words the overall state of the nervous system for example , if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey , it will often put some comb rows into reverse , spinning the mouth towards the prey
cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded , sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg shaped the common coastal sea gooseberry , pleurobrachia , sometimes has an egg shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end , although some individuals are more uniformly round from opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long , slender tentacles , each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents , so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles
the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla \( little tentacles \) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches the tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it colloblasts are specialized mushroom shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components a domed head with vesicles \( chambers \) that contain adhesive a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk the function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart in addition to colloblasts , members of the genus haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles some cnidaria eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey they may flick out very quickly \( in 40 to 60 milliseconds \) they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms and they coil round prey the unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle the wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle
there are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end , and are spaced evenly round the body the combs beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a mexican wave from each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows , and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows this forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers , via water disturbances created by the cilia
the lobata have a pair of lobes , which are muscular , cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth , running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes \( rather than trailing far behind , as in the cydippida \) between the lobes on either side of the mouth , many species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth this combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey
lobates have eight comb rows , originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes in species with \( four \) auricles , the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water , using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion , although leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion members of the lobate genera bathocyroe and ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes , so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly unlike cydippids , the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs on the same row beat in the same mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids this may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg like
the beroida , also known as nuda , have no feeding appendages , but their large pharynx , just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body , bears macrocilia at the oral end these fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to bite off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole almost always other ctenophores in front of the field of macrocilia , on the mouth lips in some species of beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that zip the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip this tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey
the cestida \( belt animals \) are ribbon shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon there is a pair of comb rows along each aboral edge , and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge , which stream back across most of the wing like body surface cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb rows there are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm temperate waters cestum veneris \( venus' girdle \) is among the largest ctenophores up to 1 5 meters \( 4 9 ft \) long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly velamen parallelum , which is typically less than 20 centimeters \( 0 66 ft \) long , can move much faster in what has been described as a darting motion
most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla bearing tentacles on the aboral surface they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular foot all but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb rows platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current
almost all species are hermaphrodites , in other words they function as both males and females at the same time except that in two species of the genus ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis fertilization is external in most species , but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch self fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self fertile
development of the fertilized eggs is direct , in other words there is no distinctive larval form , and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults in the genus beroe the juveniles , like the adults , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths in most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents in some groups , such as the flat , bottom dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea floor
when some species , including bathyctena chuni , euplokamis stationis and eurhamphaea vexilligera , are disturbed , they produce secretions \( ink \) that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults , whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals' environments , such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid ocean waters
almost all ctenophores are predators there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic if food is plentiful , they can eat 10 times their own weight per day while beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores , other surface water species prey on zooplankton \( planktonic animals \) ranging in size from the microscopic , including mollusc and fish larvae , to small adult crustaceans such as copepods , amphipods , and even krill members of the genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts \( stinging cells \) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as webs , some are ambush predators like salticid jumping spiders , and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread , as bolas spiders do this variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species the two tentacled cydippid lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea squirts that form large chain like floating colonies , and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow members of the cydippid genus pleurobrachia and the lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae
ctenophores used to be regarded as dead ends in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals it is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators , although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue detailed investigation of chum salmon , oncorhynchus keta , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores , and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population , most fish that prey on them are generalists , and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly eaters this is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the red sea the larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores , as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood
on the other hand , in the late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories \( although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the black sea \) , as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities the impact was increased by chronic overfishing , and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short term boost , causing the mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism however the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre mnemiopsis levels
because of their soft , gelatinous bodies , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerst tten , places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue until the mid 1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known , both members of the crown group , from the early devonian \( emsian \) period three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid cambrian period all three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species they also appear to have had internal organ like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores one of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth , apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular evidence from china a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the cambrian , but perhaps very different from modern species for example one fossil 's comb rows were mounted on prominent vanes the ediacaran eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly
the early cambrian sessile frond like fossil stromatoveris , from china 's chengjiang lagerst tte and dated to about 515 million years ago , is very similar to vendobionta of the preceding ediacaran period de gan shu , simon conway morris et al found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia , used for filter feeding they suggested that stromatoveris was an evolutionary aunt of ctenophores , and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system
the relationship of ctenophores to the rest of metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity it has been the focus of debate for many years ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the bilateria , sister to the cnidaria , sister to cnidaria , placozoa and bilateria , and sister to all other animal phyla a series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways \( e g , homeoboxes , nuclear receptors , the wnt signaling pathway , and sodium channels \) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios , that ctenophores are either sister to cnidaria , placozoa and bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals this position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages \( e g , porifera \) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage however , other researchers have argued that the placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that porifera \( sponges \) is the earliest diverging animal phylum instead ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes
since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid like larvae , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles richard harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids he also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid like or beroid like a molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 , using 26 species , including 4 recently discovered ones , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid like it also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small so small that the relationships between the lobata , cestida and thalassocalycida remained uncertain this suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the cretaceous paleogene extinction event 65 5 million years ago while other lineages perished when the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla , it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain

in 1872 , the central pacific railroad established a station near easterby 's by now a hugely productive wheat farm for its new southern pacific line soon there was a store around the station and the store grew the town of fresno station , later called fresno many millerton residents , drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding , moved to the new community fresno became an incorporated city in 1885 by 1931 the fresno traction company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track
before world war ii , fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods , including little armenia , german town , little italy , and chinatown in 1940 , the census bureau reported fresno 's population as 94 0 white , 3 3 black and 2 7 asian \( incongruously , chinatown was primarily a japanese neighborhood and today japanese american businesses still remain \) during 1942 , pinedale , in what is now north fresno , was the site of the pinedale assembly center , an interim facility for the relocation of fresno area japanese americans to internment camps the fresno fairgrounds was also utilized as an assembly center
in september 1958 , bank of america launched a new product called bankamericard in fresno after a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned , bankamericard went on to become the first successful credit card that is , a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance \( earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both \) in 1976 , bankamericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as visa inc
in the 1970s , the city was the subject of a song , walking into fresno , written by hall of fame guitarist bill aken and recorded by bob gallion of the world famous wwva jamboree radio and television show in wheeling , west virginia aken , adopted by mexican movie actress lupe mayorga , grew up in the neighboring town of madera and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child aken also made his first tv appearance playing guitar on the old country western show at the fresno barn
fresno has three large public parks , two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest woodward park , which features the shinzen japanese gardens , numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails , is in north fresno and is adjacent to the san joaquin river parkway roeding park , near downtown fresno , is home to the fresno chaffee zoo , and rotary storyland and playland kearney park is the largest of the fresno region 's park system and is home to historic kearney mansion and plays host to the annual civil war revisited , the largest reenactment of the civil war in the west coast of the u s
between the 1880s and world war ii , downtown fresno flourished , filled with electric street cars , and contained some of the san joaquin valley 's most beautiful architectural buildings among them , the original fresno county courthouse \( demolished \) , the fresno carnegie public library \( demolished \) , the fresno water tower , the bank of italy building , the pacific southwest building , the san joaquin light power building \( currently known as the grand 1401 \) , and the hughes hotel \( burned down \) , to name a few
fulton street in downtown fresno was fresno 's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation 's first pedestrian malls in 1964 renamed the fulton mall , the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in fresno while the fulton mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday , the mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country , including the only pierre auguste renoir piece in the world that one can walk up to and touch current plans call for the reopening of the fulton mall to automobile traffic the public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks \( up to 28' on the east side of the street \) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district
the neighborhood of sunnyside is on fresno 's far southeast side , bounded by chestnut avenue to the west its major thoroughfares are kings canyon avenue and clovis avenue although parts of sunnyside are within the city of fresno , much of the neighborhood is a county island within fresno county largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s , it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction it is also the home of the sunnyside country club , which maintains a golf course designed by william p bell
the popular neighborhood known as the tower district is centered around the historic tower theatre , which is included on the national list of historic places the theater was built in 1939 and is at olive and wishon avenues in the heart of the tower district \( the name of the theater refers to a well known landmark water tower , which is actually in another nearby area \) the tower district neighborhood is just north of downtown fresno proper , and one half mile south of fresno city college although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior , the early commercial establishments of the tower district began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after world war ii the character of small local businesses largely remains today to some extent , the businesses of the tower district were developed due to the proximity of the original fresno normal school , \( later renamed california state university at fresno \) in 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of fresno city college one half mile north of the tower district
this vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s citation needed after decades of neglect and suburban flight , the neighborhood revival followed the re opening of the tower theatre in the late 1970s , which at that time showed second and third run movies , along with classic films roger rocka 's dinner theater good company players also opened nearby in 1978 , citation needed at olive and wishon avenues fresno native audra mcdonald performed in the leading roles of evita and the wiz at the theater while she was a high school student mcdonald subsequently became a leading performer on broadway in new york city and a tony award winning actress also in the tower district is good company players' 2nd space theatre
the neighborhood features restaurants , live theater and nightclubs , as well as several independent shops and bookstores , currently operating on or near olive avenue , and all within a few hundred feet of each other since renewal , the tower district has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses today , the tower district is also known as the center of fresno 's lgbt and hipster communities additionally , tower district is also known as the center of fresno 's local punk goth deathrock and heavy metal community citation needed
the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes , many of which have been restored in recent decades the area includes many california bungalow and american craftsman style homes , spanish colonial revival style architecture , mediterranean revival style architecture , mission revival style architecture , and many storybook houses designed by fresno architects , hilliard , taylor wheeler the residential architecture of the tower district contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of fresno
homes from the early 20th century line this boulevard in the heart of the historic alta vista tract the section of huntington boulevard between first street on the west to cedar avenue on the east is the home to many large , stately homes the original development of this area began circa 1910 , on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field the alta vista tract , as the land would become known , was mapped by william stranahan for the pacific improvement corporation , and was officially platted in 1911 the tract 's boundaries were balch avenue on the south , cedar avenue on the east , the rear property line of platt avenue \( east of sixth street \) and platt avenue \( west of sixth street \) on the north , and first street on the west the subdivision was annexed to the city in january 1912 , in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community at the time of its admission to the city , the alta vista tract was uninhabited but landscaped , although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon in 1914 developers billings meyering acquired the tract , completed street development , provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service , and began marketing the property with fervor a mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes this rapid development was no doubt hastened by the fresno traction company right of way along huntington boulevard , which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the county hospital
the west side of fresno , also often called southwest fresno , is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city the neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway \( which divides it from downtown fresno \) , west of the 41 freeway and south of nielsen ave \( or the newly constructed 180 freeway \) , and extends to the city limits to the west and south the neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of fresno 's african american community it is culturally diverse and also includes significant mexican american and asian american \( principally hmong or laotian \) populations
the neighborhood includes kearney boulevard , named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire m theo kearney , which extends from fresno street in southwest fresno about 20 mi \( 32 km \) west to kerman , california a small , two lane rural road for most of its length , kearney boulevard is lined with tall palm trees the roughly half mile stretch of kearney boulevard between fresno street and thorne ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for fresno 's elite african american families another section , brookhaven , on the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm , was given the name by the fresno city council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood 's image the isolated subdivision was for years known as the dogg pound in reference to a local gang , and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime
while many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before , the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the fresno housing authority the us department of housing and urban development has also built small subdivisions of single family homes in the area for purchase by low income working families there have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood , including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of fresno and b streets , an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood , and some new section 8 apartments have been built along church ave west of elm st cargill meat solutions and foster farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood , and the stench from these \( and other small industrial facilities \) has long plagued area residents the fresno chandler executive airport is also on the west side due to its position on the edge of the city and years of neglect by developers , is not a true inner city neighborhood , and there are many vacant lots , strawberry fields and vineyards throughout the neighborhood the neighborhood has very little retail activity , aside from the area near fresno street and state route 99 freeway \( kearney palm shopping center , built in the late 1990s \) and small corner markets scattered throughout
in the north eastern part of fresno , woodward park was founded by the late ralph woodward , a long time fresno resident he bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in northeast fresno the park lies on the south bank of the san joaquin river between highway 41 and friant road the initial 235 acres \( 0 95 km2 \) , combined with additional acres acquired later by the city , brings the park to a sizable 300 acres \( 1 2 km2 \) now packed with amenities , woodward park is the only regional park of its size in the central valley the southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing the park has a multi use amphitheatre that seats up to 2 , 500 people , authentic japanese garden , fenced dog park , two mile \( 3 km \) equestrian trail , exercise par course , three children 's playgrounds , a lake , 3 small ponds , 7 picnic areas and five miles \( 8 km \) of multipurpose trails that are part of the san joaquin river parkway 's lewis s eaton trail when complete , the lewis s eaton trail system will cover 22 miles \( 35 km \) between highway 99 and friant dam the park 's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life the park 's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010 , and has hosted performances by acts such as deftones , tech n9ne , and sevendust as well as numerous others the park is open april through october , 6am to 10pm and november through march , 6am to 7pm woodward park is home to the annual cif \( california interscholastic federation \) state championship cross country meet , which takes place in late november it is also the home of the woodward shakespeare festival which began performances in the park in 2005
formed in 1946 , sierra sky park airport is a residential airport community born of a unique agreement in transportation law to allow personal aircraft and automobiles to share certain roads sierra sky park was the first aviation community to be built citation needed and there are now numerous such communities across the united states and around the world developer william smilie created the nation 's first planned aviation community still in operation today , the public use airport provides a unique neighborhood that spawned interest and similar communities nationwide

to avoid interference with existing vhf television stations in the san francisco bay area and those planned for chico , sacramento , salinas , and stockton , the federal communications commission decided that fresno would only have uhf television stations the very first fresno television station to begin broadcasting was kmj tv , which debuted on june 1 , 1953 kmj is now known as nbc affiliate ksee other fresno stations include abc o o kfsn , cbs affiliate kgpe , cw affiliate kfre , fox affiliate kmph , mntv affiliate kail , pbs affiliate kvpt , telemundo o o knso , univision o o kftv , and mundofox and azteca affiliate kgmc dt
fresno is served by state route 99 , the main north south freeway that connects the major population centers of the california central valley state route 168 , the sierra freeway , heads east to the city of clovis and huntington lake state route 41 \( yosemite freeway eisenhower freeway \) comes into fresno from atascadero in the south , and then heads north to yosemite state route 180 \( kings canyon freeway \) comes from the west via mendota , and from the east in kings canyon national park going towards the city of reedley
fresno is the largest u s city not directly linked to an interstate highway when the interstate highway system was created in the 1950s , the decision was made to build what is now interstate 5 on the west side of the central valley , and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region , instead of upgrading what is now state route 99 due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along sr 99 , as well as the desirability of federal funding , much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system , most likely as interstate 9 major improvements to signage , lane width , median separation , vertical clearance , and other concerns are currently underway
passenger rail service is provided by amtrak san joaquins the main passenger rail station is the recently renovated historic santa fe railroad depot in downtown fresno the bakersfield stockton mainlines of the burlington northern santa fe railway and union pacific railroad railroads cross in fresno , and both railroads maintain railyards within the city the san joaquin valley railroad also operates former southern pacific branchlines heading west and south out of the city the city of fresno is planned to serve the future california high speed rail
starting in the late 1950s , american computer scientist paul baran developed the concept distributed adaptive message block switching with the goal to provide a fault tolerant , efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation , funded by the us department of defense this concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre allocation of network bandwidth , largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the bell system the new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of donald davies at the national physical laboratory \( united kingdom \) \( npl \) in the late 1960s davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in europe in the decade following , including the incorporation of the concept in the early arpanet in the united states
packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm , circuit switching , a method which pre allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session , each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes in cases of billable services , such as cellular communication services , circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred , while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages
packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes \( packet switches or routers \) packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first in , first out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing , traffic shaping , or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service , such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket in case of a shared physical medium \( such as radio or 10base5 \) , the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme
baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the rand corporation for the us air force into survivable communications networks , first presented to the air force in the summer of 1961 as briefing b 265 , later published as rand report p 2626 in 1962 , and finally in report rm 3420 in 1964 report p 2626 described a general architecture for a large scale , distributed , survivable communications network the work focuses on three key ideas use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks , later called packets , and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching
starting in 1965 , donald davies at the national physical laboratory , uk , independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by baran he called it packet switching , a more accessible name than baran 's , and proposed to build a nationwide network in the uk he gave a talk on the proposal in 1966 , after which a person from the ministry of defence \( mod \) told him about baran 's work a member of davies' team \( roger scantlebury \) met lawrence roberts at the 1967 acm symposium on operating system principles and suggested it for use in the arpanet
in connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information the packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out of order delivery each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers it may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet this precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination , but means that much more information is needed in the packet header , which is therefore larger , and this information needs to be looked up in power hungry content addressable memory each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes potentially , the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection oriented system has to do in connection set up , but with less information as to the application 's requirements at the destination , the original message data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number thus a virtual connection , also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end user by a transport layer protocol , although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service
connection oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set up phase , when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes the signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table the packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , timestamp , or sequence number , which is different for different packets
both x 25 and frame relay provide connection oriented operations but x 25 does it at the network layer of the osi model frame relay does it at level two , the data link layer another major difference between x 25 and frame relay is that x 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted frame relay does not define any such handshakes x 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network it only operates at the user network interface \( uni \) thus , the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network x 25 does specify some limited re transmission procedures at the uni , and its link layer protocol \( lapb \) provides conventional hdlc type link management procedures frame relay is a modified version of isdn 's layer two protocol , lapd and lapb as such , its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link , not end to end any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols the x 25 uni protocol is part of the x 25 protocol suite , which consists of the lower three layers of the osi model it was widely used at the uni for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s , to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks some implementations used x 25 within the network as well , but its connection oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient frame relay operates principally at layer two of the osi model however , its address field \( the data link connection id , or dlci \) can be used at the osi network layer , with a minimum set of procedures thus , it rids itself of many x 25 layer 3 encumbrances , but still has the dlci as an id beyond a node to node layer two link protocol the simplicity of frame relay makes it faster and more efficient than x 25 because frame relay is a data link layer protocol , like x 25 it does not define internal network routing operations for x 25 its packet ids the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses the same is true for frame relays dlci how this is done is up to the network provider frame relay , by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection oriented at layer two , by using the hdlc lapd lapb set asynchronous balanced mode \( sabm \) x 25 connections are typically established for each communication session , but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the uni without the connection oriented handshake for a while , frame relay was used to interconnect lans across wide area networks however , x 25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol \( ip \) at the network layer , and the asynchronous transfer mode \( atm \) and or versions of multi protocol label switching \( mpls \) at layer two a typical configuration is to run ip over atm or a version of mpls uyless black , x 25 and related protocols , ieee computer society , 1991 uyless black , frame relay networks , mcgraw hill , 1998 uyless black , mpls and label switching networks , prentice hall , 2001 uyless black , atm , volume i , prentice hall , 1995
arpanet and sita hln became operational in 1969 before the introduction of x 25 in 1973 , about twenty different network technologies had been developed two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core in the datagram system , the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets the user datagram protocol \( udp \) is an example of a datagram protocol in the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host this results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model the x 25 protocol suite uses this network type
appletalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by apple inc in 1985 for apple macintosh computers it was the primary protocol used by apple devices through the 1980s and 90s appletalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server the appletalk system automatically assigned addresses , updated the distributed namespace , and configured any required inter network routing it was a plug n play system
the cyclades packet switching network was a french research network designed and directed by louis pouzin first demonstrated in 1973 , it was developed to explore alternatives to the early arpanet design and to support network research generally it was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , rather than the network itself , using unreliable datagrams and associated end to end protocol mechanisms concepts of this network influenced later arpanet architecture
decnet is a suite of network protocols created by digital equipment corporation , originally released in 1975 in order to connect two pdp 11 minicomputers it evolved into one of the first peer to peer network architectures , thus transforming dec into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s initially built with three layers , it later \( 1982 \) evolved into a seven layer osi compliant networking protocol the decnet protocols were designed entirely by digital equipment corporation however , decnet phase ii \( and later \) were open standards with published specifications , and several implementations were developed outside dec , including one for linux
in 1965 , at the instigation of warner sinback , a data network based on this voice phone network was designed to connect ge 's four computer sales and service centers \( schenectady , phoenix , chicago , and phoenix \) to facilitate a computer time sharing service , apparently the world 's first commercial online service \( in addition to selling ge computers , the centers were computer service bureaus , offering batch processing services they lost money from the beginning , and sinback , a high level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around he decided that a time sharing system , based on kemney 's work at dartmouth which used a computer on loan from ge could be profitable warner was right \)
merit network , inc , an independent non profit 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) corporation governed by michigan 's public universities , was formed in 1966 as the michigan educational research information triad to explore computer networking between three of michigan 's public universities as a means to help the state 's educational and economic development with initial support from the state of michigan and the national science foundation \( nsf \) , the packet switched network was first demonstrated in december 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the ibm mainframe computer systems at the university of michigan in ann arbor and wayne state university in detroit in october 1972 connections to the cdc mainframe at michigan state university in east lansing completed the triad over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections , host to host batch connections \( remote job submission , remote printing , batch file transfer \) , interactive file transfer , gateways to the tymnet and telenet public data networks , x 25 host attachments , gateways to x 25 data networks , ethernet attached hosts , and eventually tcp ip and additional public universities in michigan join the network all of this set the stage for merit 's role in the nsfnet project starting in the mid 1980s
telenet was the first fcc licensed public data network in the united states it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public he had tried to interest at t in buying the technology , but the monopoly 's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future bolt , beranack and newman \( bbn \) provided the financing it initially used arpanet technology but changed the host interface to x 25 and the terminal interface to x 29 telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the ccitt telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975 it went public in 1979 and was then sold to gte
tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in san jose , ca that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used x 25 , sna sdlc , bsc and ascii interfaces to connect host computers \( servers \) at thousands of large companies , educational institutions , and government agencies users typically connected via dial up connections or dedicated async connections the business consisted of a large public network that supported dial up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies \( mostly banks and airlines \) to build their own dedicated networks the private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the u s and internationally via x 25 x 75 gateways \( interesting note tymnet was not named after mr tyme another employee suggested the name \)
there were two kinds of x 25 networks some such as datapac and transpac were initially implemented with an x 25 external interface some older networks such as telenet and tymnet were modified to provide a x 25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes datapac was developed by bell northern research which was a joint venture of bell canada \( a common carrier \) and northern telecom \( a telecommunications equipment supplier \) northern telecom sold several datapac clones to foreign ptts including the deutsche bundespost x 75 and x 121 allowed the interconnection of national x 25 networks a user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the dnic of the remote network as part of the destination address citation needed
austpac was an australian public x 25 network operated by telstra started by telecom australia in the early 1980s , austpac was australia 's first public packet switched data network , supporting applications such as on line betting , financial applications the australian tax office made use of austpac and remote terminal access to academic institutions , who maintained their connections to austpac up until the mid late 1990s in some cases access can be via a dial up terminal to a pad , or , by linking a permanent x 25 node to the network citation needed
datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the dutch ptt telecom \( now known as kpn \) strictly speaking datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines \( using the x 121 dnic 2041 \) , the name also referred to the public pad service telepad \( using the dnic 2049 \) and because the main videotex service used the network and modified pad devices as infrastructure the name datanet 1 was used for these services as well although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of kpn contributed to the confusion
the computer science network \( csnet \) was a computer network funded by the u s national science foundation \( nsf \) that began operation in 1981 its purpose was to extend networking benefits , for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to arpanet , due to funding or authorization limitations it played a significant role in spreading awareness of , and access to , national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global internet
internet2 is a not for profit united states computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities , industry , and government the internet2 community , in partnership with qwest , built the first internet2 network , called abilene , in 1998 and was a prime investor in the national lambdarail \( nlr \) project in 2006 , internet2 announced a partnership with level 3 communications to launch a brand new nationwide network , boosting its capacity from 10 gbit s to 100 gbit s in october , 2007 , internet2 officially retired abilene and now refers to its new , higher capacity network as the internet2 network
the national science foundation network \( nsfnet \) was a program of coordinated , evolving projects sponsored by the national science foundation \( nsf \) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the united states nsfnet was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks operating at speeds of 56 kbit s , 1 5 mbit s \( t1 \) , and 45 mbit s \( t3 \) that were constructed to support nsf 's networking initiatives from 1985 1995 initially created to link researchers to the nation 's nsf funded supercomputing centers , through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the internet backbone
the very high speed backbone network service \( vbns \) came on line in april 1995 as part of a national science foundation \( nsf \) sponsored project to provide high speed interconnection between nsf sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the united states the network was engineered and operated by mci telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the nsf by 1998 , the vbns had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with ds 3 \( 45 mbit s \) , oc 3c \( 155 mbit s \) , and oc 12c \( 622 mbit s \) links on an all oc 12c backbone , a substantial engineering feat for that time the vbns installed one of the first ever production oc 48c \( 2 5 gbit s \) ip links in february 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to oc 48c
the black death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia , where it then travelled along the silk road , reaching crimea by 1343 from there , it was most likely carried by oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships spreading throughout the mediterranean and europe , the black death is estimated to have killed 30 60 of europe 's total population in total , the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350 375 million in the 14th century the world population as a whole did not recover to pre plague levels until the 17th century the plague recurred occasionally in europe until the 19th century
the plague disease , caused by yersinia pestis , is enzootic \( commonly present \) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents , including marmots , in various areas including central asia , kurdistan , western asia , northern india and uganda nestorian graves dating to 1338 39 near lake issyk kul in kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic , from which it could easily have spread to china and india in october 2010 , medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in china in china , the 13th century mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading however , economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century in the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine , starting in 1331 , with a deadly plague arriving soon after epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million chinese and other asians during the 15 years before it reached constantinople in 1347
plague was reportedly first introduced to europe via genoese traders at the port city of kaffa in the crimea in 1347 after a protracted siege , during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering from the disease , the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of kaffa to infect the inhabitants the genoese traders fled , taking the plague by ship into sicily and the south of europe , whence it spread north whether or not this hypothesis is accurate , it is clear that several existing conditions such as war , famine , and weather contributed to the severity of the black death
from italy , the disease spread northwest across europe , striking france , spain , portugal and england by june 1348 , then turned and spread east through germany and scandinavia from 1348 to 1350 it was introduced in norway in 1349 when a ship landed at ask y , then spread to bj rgvin \( modern bergen \) and iceland finally it spread to northwestern russia in 1351 the plague was somewhat less common in parts of europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours , including the kingdom of poland , the majority of the basque country , isolated parts of belgium and the netherlands , and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent
the plague struck various countries in the middle east during the pandemic , leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures as it spread to western europe , the disease entered the region from southern russia also by autumn 1347 , the plague reached alexandria in egypt , probably through the port 's trade with constantinople , and ports on the black sea during 1347 , the disease travelled eastward to gaza , and north along the eastern coast to cities in lebanon , syria and palestine , including ashkelon , acre , jerusalem , sidon , damascus , homs , and aleppo in 1348 49 , the disease reached antioch the city 's residents fled to the north , most of them dying during the journey , but the infection had been spread to the people of asia minor citation needed
gasquet \( 1908 \) claimed that the latin name atra mors \( black death \) for the 14th century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on danish history by j i pontanus vulgo ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant \( commonly and from its effects , they called it the black death \) the name spread through scandinavia and then germany , gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th century epidemic as a proper name in england , it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the black death
medical knowledge had stagnated during the middle ages the most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in paris in a report to the king of france that blamed the heavens , in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a great pestilence in the air this report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers that the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory today , this is known as the miasma theory the word 'plague' had no special significance at this time , and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the middle ages gave it the name that has become the medical term
the dominant explanation for the black death is the plague theory , which attributes the outbreak to yersinia pestis , also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern china in 1865 , eventually spreading to india the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited hong kong in 1894 , among whom was the french swiss bacteriologist alexandre yersin , after whom the pathogen was named yersinia pestis the mechanism by which y pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by paul louis simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating y pestis several days after feeding on an infected host this blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas , which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation , resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site , infecting the host the bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents one resistant to the disease , which act as hosts , keeping the disease endemic , and a second that lack resistance when the second population dies , the fleas move on to other hosts , including people , thus creating a human epidemic
the historian francis aidan gasquet wrote about the 'great pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that it would appear to be some form of the ordinary eastern or bubonic plague he was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the black death for the second edition in 1908 , implicating rats and fleas in the process , and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics , such as the justinian plague that was prevalent in the eastern roman empire from 541 to 700 ce
other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists the modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30 75 and symptoms including fever of 38 41 c \( 100 106 f \) , headaches , painful aching joints , nausea and vomiting , and a general feeling of malaise left untreated , of those that contract the bubonic plague , 80 percent die within eight days pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent symptoms include fever , cough , and blood tinged sputum as the disease progresses , sputum becomes free flowing and bright red septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms , with a mortality rate near 100 symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches \( purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation \) in cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague , the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes
in october 2010 , the open access scientific journal plos pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of yersinia pestis in the black death following the disputed identification by drancourt and raoult in 1998 they assessed the presence of dna rna with polymerase chain reaction \( pcr \) techniques for y pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern , central and southern europe that were associated archaeologically with the black death and subsequent resurgences the authors concluded that this new research , together with prior analyses from the south of france and germany , ends the debate about the etiology of the black death , and unambiguously demonstrates that y pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated europe during the middle ages
the study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades \( genetic branches \) of the y pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves these clades \( which are thought to be extinct \) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern y pestis strains y p orientalis and y p medievalis , suggesting the plague may have entered europe in two waves surveys of plague pit remains in france and england indicate the first variant entered europe through the port of marseille around november 1347 and spread through france over the next two years , eventually reaching england in the spring of 1349 , where it spread through the country in three epidemics surveys of plague pit remains from the dutch town of bergen op zoom showed the y pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the low countries from 1350 differed from that found in britain and france , implying bergen op zoom \( and possibly other parts of the southern netherlands \) was not directly infected from england or france in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague , different from those in britain and france , may have been carried to the low countries from norway , the hanseatic cities or another site
the results of the haensch study have since been confirmed and amended based on genetic evidence derived from black death victims in the east smithfield burial site in england , schuenemann et al concluded in 2011 that the black death in medieval europe was caused by a variant of y pestis that may no longer exist a study published in nature in october 2011 sequenced the genome of y pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the black death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease
the plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of british bacteriologist j f d shrewsbury in 1970 , who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague , leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations in 1984 zoologist graham twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly , and his doubts about the identity of the black death have been taken up by a number of authors , including samuel k cohn , jr \( 2002 \) , david herlihy \( 1997 \) , and susan scott and christopher duncan \( 2001 \)
it is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms , but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period most work has been done on the spread of the plague in england , and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100 as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the domesday book and the year 1377 estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy
in addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the black death are not unique \( and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague \) that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance and that the dna results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples from other mass graves other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries temperatures that are too cold in northern europe for the survival of fleas that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the black death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague that mortality rates of the black death appear to be very high that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the black death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas and that the pattern of the black death , with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years , differs from modern bubonic plague which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare ups
a variety of alternatives to the y pestis have been put forward twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax , and norman cantor \( 2001 \) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics scott and duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to ebola archaeologist barney sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in london and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the y pestis was spread from fleas on rats he argues that transmission must have been person to person however , no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance many scholars arguing for the y pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases , including typhus , smallpox and respiratory infections in addition to the bubonic infection , others point to additional septicemic \( a type of blood poisoning \) and pneumonic \( an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body \) forms of the plague , which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms in 2014 , scientists with public health england announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the clerkenwell area of london , as well as of wills registered in london during the period , which supported the pneumonic hypothesis
the most widely accepted estimate for the middle east , including iraq , iran and syria , during this time , is for a death rate of about a third the black death killed about 40 of egypt 's population half of paris 's population of 100 , 000 people died in italy , the population of florence was reduced from 110 120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351 at least 60 of the population of hamburg and bremen perished , and a similar percentage of londoners may have died from the disease as well interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in central london found well preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre planning and christian burials at this time before 1350 , there were about 170 , 000 settlements in germany , and this was reduced by nearly 40 , 000 by 1450 in 1348 , the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins , about a third of the european population had already perished in crowded cities , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 of the population to die the disease bypassed some areas , and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the black death
the plague repeatedly returned to haunt europe and the mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries according to biraben , the plague was present somewhere in europe in every year between 1346 and 1671 the second pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years 1360 63 1374 1400 1438 39 1456 57 1464 66 1481 85 1500 03 1518 31 1544 48 1563 66 1573 88 1596 99 1602 11 1623 40 1644 54 and 1664 67 subsequent outbreaks , though severe , marked the retreat from most of europe \( 18th century \) and northern africa \( 19th century \) according to geoffrey parker , france alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628 31
in england , in the absence of census figures , historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300 , and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million by the end of 1350 , the black death subsided , but it never really died out in england over the next few hundred years , further outbreaks occurred in 1361 62 , 1369 , 1379 83 , 1389 93 , and throughout the first half of the 15th century an outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10 15 of the population , while the death rate of the plague of 1479 80 could have been as high as 20 the most general outbreaks in tudor and stuart england seem to have begun in 1498 , 1535 , 1543 , 1563 , 1589 , 1603 , 1625 , and 1636 , and ended with the great plague of london in 1665
in 1466 , perhaps 40 , 000 people died of the plague in paris during the 16th and 17th centuries , the plague was present in paris around 30 per cent of the time the black death ravaged europe for three years before it continued on into russia , where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490 plague epidemics ravaged london in 1563 , 1593 , 1603 , 1625 , 1636 , and 1665 , reducing its population by 10 to 30 during those years over 10 of amsterdam 's population died in 1623 25 , and again in 1635 36 , 1655 , and 1664 plague occurred in venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528 the plague of 1576 77 killed 50 , 000 in venice , almost a third of the population late outbreaks in central europe included the italian plague of 1629 1631 , which is associated with troop movements during the thirty years' war , and the great plague of vienna in 1679 over 60 of norway 's population died in 1348 50 the last plague outbreak ravaged oslo in 1654
in the first half of the 17th century , a plague claimed some 1 7 million victims in italy , or about 14 of the population in 1656 , the plague killed about half of naples' 300 , 000 inhabitants more than 1 25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th century spain the plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of seville by half in 1709 13 , a plague epidemic that followed the great northern war \( 1700 21 , sweden v russia and allies \) killed about 100 , 000 in sweden , and 300 , 000 in prussia the plague killed two thirds of the inhabitants of helsinki , and claimed a third of stockholm 's population europe 's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in marseille
the black death ravaged much of the islamic world plague was present in at least one location in the islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850 plague repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620 21 , and again in 1654 57 , 1665 , 1691 , and 1740 42 plague remained a major event in ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century between 1701 and 1750 , thirty seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in constantinople , and an additional thirty one between 1751 and 1800 baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague , and sometimes two thirds of its population has been wiped out
there are three major types of rock igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic the rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock , and magma when a rock crystallizes from melt \( magma and or lava \) , it is an igneous rock this rock can be weathered and eroded , and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock , or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric the sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered , eroded , deposited , and lithified , ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock sedimentary rock may also be re eroded and redeposited , and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism all three types of rocks may be re melted when this happens , a new magma is formed , from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize
in the 1960s , a series of discoveries , the most important of which was seafloor spreading , showed that the earth 's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle , which is called the asthenosphere there is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction , because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle this coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics
the development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid earth long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries mid ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , where one plate subducts under another transform boundaries , such as the san andreas fault system , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for alfred wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the earth over geologic time they also provided a driving force for crustal deformation , and a new setting for the observations of structural geology the power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle
seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the earth early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core \( where shear waves were not able to propagate \) and a dense solid inner core these advances led to the development of a layered model of the earth , with a crust and lithosphere on top , the mantle below \( separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers \) , and the outer core and inner core below that more recently , seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a ct scan these images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the earth , and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model
the following four timelines show the geologic time scale the first shows the entire time from the formation of the earth to the present , but this compresses the most recent eon therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale the second scale compresses the most recent era , so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale since the quaternary is a very short period with short epochs , it is further expanded in the fourth scale the second , third , and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks the holocene \( the latest epoch \) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right , another reason for expanding the fourth scale the pleistocene \( p \) epoch q stands for the quaternary period
the principle of cross cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut faults are younger than the rocks they cut accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault
the principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions \( or clasts \) are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them for example , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer a similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found these foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix as a result , xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them
the principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks as organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world , their presence or \( sometimes \) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found based on principles laid out by william smith almost a hundred years before the publication of charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought the principle becomes quite complex , however , given the uncertainties of fossilization , the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat \( facies change in sedimentary strata \) , and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time
at the beginning of the 20th century , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods this changed the understanding of geologic time previously , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another with isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages
for many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature , the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice these are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies common methods include uranium lead dating , potassium argon dating , argon argon dating and uranium thorium dating these methods are used for a variety of applications dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques these methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography
when rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker because rock units , other than muds , do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways through faulting and folding in the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock because deeper rock is often older , as noted by the principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones movement along faults can result in folding , either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along , forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault deeper in the earth , rocks behave plastically , and fold instead of faulting these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating antiforms , or where it buckles downwards , creating synforms if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively if some of the units in the fold are facing downward , the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline , and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up direction is unknown , they are simply called by the most general terms , antiforms and synforms
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner this is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower this typically results in younger units being placed below older units stretching of units can result in their thinning in fact , there is a location within the maria fold and thrust belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the grand canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed these stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , known as boudins , after the french word for sausage , because of their visual similarity
the addition of new rock units , both depositionally and intrusively , often occurs during deformation faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels these sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface , and igneous intrusions enter from below dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed this can result in the emplacement of dike swarms , such as those that are observable across the canadian shield , or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano
all of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment , and do not necessarily occur in a single order the hawaiian islands , for example , consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows the sedimentary sequences of the mid continental united states and the grand canyon in the southwestern united states contain almost undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since cambrian time other areas are much more geologically complex in the southwestern united states , sedimentary , volcanic , and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed , faulted , foliated , and folded even older rocks , such as the acasta gneiss of the slave craton in northwestern canada , the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis in addition , these processes can occur in stages in many places , the grand canyon in the southwestern united states being a very visible example , the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed , and then deformation ended and the upper , undeformed units were deposited although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur , and they can occur any number of times , these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area
geologists use a number of field , laboratory , and numerical modeling methods to decipher earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the earth in typical geological investigations , geologists use primary information related to petrology \( the study of rocks \) , stratigraphy \( the study of sedimentary layers \) , and structural geology \( the study of positions of rock units and their deformation \) in many cases , geologists also study modern soils , rivers , landscapes , and glaciers investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways , and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface
in addition to identifying rocks in the field , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe in an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane polarized and cross polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens in the electron microprobe , individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units
petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear , and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes this research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks this work can also help to explain processes that occur within the earth , such as subduction and magma chamber evolution
structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks they also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area in addition , they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings
among the most well known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges , which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries in the analog versions of these experiments , horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop , which results in realistic looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered \( all angles remain the same \) orogenic wedge numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt this helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range these studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure , temperature , space , and time
in the laboratory , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the earth , interpret past environments , and locate areas for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction
in the laboratory , biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them these fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate
some modern scholars , such as fielding h garrison , are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to persia after the muslim conquests had come to an end abu al rayhan al biruni \( 973 1048 ce \) was one of the earliest persian geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of india , hypothesizing that the indian subcontinent was once a sea drawing from greek and indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the muslim conquests , the persian scholar ibn sina \( avicenna , 981 1037 \) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains , the origin of earthquakes , and other topics central to modern geology , which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science in china , the polymath shen kuo \( 1031 1095 \) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean , he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt
james hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist in 1785 he presented a paper entitled theory of the earth to the royal society of edinburgh in his paper , he explained his theory that the earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land hutton published a two volume version of his ideas in 1795 \( vol 1 , vol 2 \)
the first geological map of the u s was produced in 1809 by william maclure in 1807 , maclure commenced the self imposed task of making a geological survey of the united states almost every state in the union was traversed and mapped by him , the allegheny mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times the results of his unaided labours were submitted to the american philosophical society in a memoir entitled observations on the geology of the united states explanatory of a geological map , and published in the society 's transactions , together with the nation 's first geological map this antedates william smith 's geological map of england by six years , although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks
sir charles lyell first published his famous book , principles of geology , in 1830 this book , which influenced the thought of charles darwin , successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism this theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the earth 's history and are still occurring today in contrast , catastrophism is the theory that earth 's features formed in single , catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter though hutton believed in uniformitarianism , the idea was not widely accepted at the time
newcastle upon tyne \( rp i nju k s l p n ta n locally i nju k s l p n ta n \) , commonly known as newcastle , is a city in tyne and wear , north east england , 103 miles \( 166 km \) south of edinburgh and 277 miles \( 446 km \) north of london on the northern bank of the river tyne , 8 5 mi \( 13 7 km \) from the north sea newcastle is the most populous city in the north east and tyneside the eighth most populous conurbation in the united kingdom newcastle is a member of the english core cities group and is a member of the eurocities network of european cities newcastle was part of the county of northumberland until 1400 , when it became a county itself , a status it retained until becoming part of tyne and wear in 1974 not in citation given the regional nickname and dialect for people from newcastle and the surrounding area is geordie
the city developed around the roman settlement pons aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by robert curthose , william the conqueror 's eldest son the city grew as an important centre for the wool trade in the 14th century , and later became a major coal mining area the port developed in the 16th century and , along with the shipyards lower down the river tyne , was amongst the world 's largest shipbuilding and ship repairing centres newcastle 's economy includes corporate headquarters , learning , digital technology , retail , tourism and cultural centres , from which the city contributes 13 billion towards the united kingdom 's gva among its icons are newcastle brown ale newcastle united football club and the tyne bridge it has hosted the world 's most popular half marathon , the great north run , since it began in 1981
the first recorded settlement in what is now newcastle was pons aelius , a roman fort and bridge across the river tyne it was given the family name of the roman emperor hadrian , who founded it in the 2nd century ad this rare honour suggests that hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of britain the population of pons aelius at this period was estimated at 2 , 000 fragments of hadrian 's wall are still visible in parts of newcastle , particularly along the west road the course of the roman wall can be traced eastwards to the segedunum roman fort in wallsend the wall 's end and to the supply fort arbeia in south shields the extent of hadrian 's wall was 73 miles \( 117 km \) , spanning the width of britain the wall incorporated the vallum , a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds , and was constructed primarily for defence , to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of pictish tribes from the north , not as a fighting line for a major invasion
throughout the middle ages , newcastle was england 's northern fortress incorporated first by henry ii , the city had a new charter granted by elizabeth in 1589 a 25 foot \( 7 6 m \) high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century , to defend it from invaders during the border war against scotland the scots king william the lion was imprisoned in newcastle in 1174 , and edward i brought the stone of scone and william wallace south through the town newcastle was successfully defended against the scots three times during the 14th century , and was created a county corporate with its own sheriff by henry iv in 1400
from 1530 a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from tyneside to newcastle quayside , giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of newcastle burgesses known as the hostmen this monopoly , which lasted for a considerable time , helped newcastle prosper and develop into a major town the phrase taking coals to newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538 the phrase itself means a pointless pursuit in the 18th century american timothy dexter , an entrepreneur , widely regarded as an eccentric , defied this idiom he was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him however his shipment arrived on the tyne during a strike that had crippled local production unexpectedly he made a considerable profit
in the sandgate area , to the east of the city and beside the river , resided the close knit community of keelmen and their families they were so called because they worked on the keels , boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers , for export to london and elsewhere in the 1630s about 7 , 000 out of 20 , 000 inhabitants of newcastle died of plague , more than one third of the population specifically within the year 1636 , it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the society of antiquaries that 47 of the then population of newcastle died from the epidemic this may also have been the most devastating loss in any british city in this period
during the english civil war , the north declared for the king in a bid to gain newcastle and the tyne , cromwell 's allies , the scots , captured the town of newburn in 1644 the scots then captured the reinforced fortification on the lawe in south shields following a siege in 1644 the city was then besieged for many months and was eventually stormed \( 'with roaring drummes' \) and sacked by cromwell 's allies the grateful king bestowed the motto fortiter defendit triumphans \( triumphing by a brave defence \) upon the town charles i was imprisoned in newcastle by the scots in 1646 7
in the 19th century , shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city 's prosperity and the city was a powerhouse of the industrial revolution this revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city in 1817 the maling company , at one time the largest pottery company in the world , moved to the city the victorian industrial revolution brought industrial structures that included the 2 1 2 mile \( 4 0 km \) victoria tunnelling , built in 1842 , which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes on 3 february 1879 , mosley street in the city , was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting innovations in newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps , stephenson 's rocket , lord armstrong 's artillery , be ro flour , joseph swan 's electric light bulbs , and charles parsons' invention of the steam turbine , which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity in 1882 , newcastle became the seat of an anglican diocese , with st nicholas' church becoming its cathedral
in large parts , newcastle still retains a medieval street layout narrow alleys or 'chares' , most of which can only be traversed by foot , still exist in abundance , particularly around the riverside stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant castle keep , originally recorded in the 14th century , remain intact in places close , sandhill and quayside contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th 18th centuries , including bessie surtees house , the cooperage and lloyds quayside bars , derwentwater house and house of tides , a restaurant situated at a grade i listed 16th century merchant 's house at 28 30 close
the city has an extensive neoclassical centre referred to as tyneside classical largely developed in the 1830s by richard grainger and john dobson , and recently extensively restored broadcaster and writer stuart maconie described newcastle as england 's best looking city and the late german born british scholar of architecture , nikolaus pevsner , describes grey street as one of the finest streets in england the street curves down from grey 's monument towards the valley of the river tyne and was voted england 's finest street in 2005 in a survey of bbc radio 4 listeners in the google street view awards of 2010 , grey street came 3rd in the british picturesque category osborne road came 4th in the foodie street category a portion of grainger town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the eldon square shopping centre , including all but one side of the original eldon square itself
another green space in newcastle is the town moor , lying immediately north of the city centre it is larger than london 's famous hyde park and hampstead heath put together and the freemen of the city have the right to graze cattle on it the right incidentally extends to the pitch of st james' park , newcastle united football club 's ground , though this is not exercised , although the freemen do collect rent for the loss of privilege honorary freemen include bob geldof , king harald v of norway , bobby robson , alan shearer , the late nelson mandela and the royal shakespeare company the hoppings funfair , said to be the largest travelling funfair in europe , is held here annually in june
large scale regeneration has replaced former shipping premises with imposing new office developments an innovative tilting bridge , the gateshead millennium bridge was commissioned by gateshead council and has integrated the older newcastle quayside more closely with major cultural developments in gateshead , including the baltic centre for contemporary art , the venue for the turner prize 2011 and the norman foster designed the sage gateshead music centre the newcastle and gateshead quaysides are now a thriving , cosmopolitan area with bars , restaurants and public spaces as a tourist promotion , newcastle and gateshead have linked together under the banner newcastlegateshead , to spearhead the regeneration of the north east the river tyne had the temporary bambuco bridge in 2008 for ten days it was not made for walking , road or cycling , but was just a sculpture
the historic heart of newcastle is the grainger town area established on classical streets built by richard grainger , a builder and developer , between 1835 and 1842 , some of newcastle upon tyne 's finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre including grainger market , theatre royal , grey street , grainger street and clayton street these buildings are predominantly four stories high , with vertical dormers , domes , turrets and spikes richard grainger was said to 'have found newcastle of bricks and timber and left it in stone' of grainger town 's 450 buildings , 244 are listed , of which 29 are grade i and 49 are grade ii
the grainger market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the butcher market the grainger market itself , was opened in 1835 and was newcastle 's first indoor market at the time of its opening in 1835 it was said to be one of the largest and most beautiful markets in europe the opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests , and the laing art gallery has a painting of this event with the exception of the timber roof which was destroyed by a fire in 1901 and replaced by latticed steel arches the market is largely in its original condition the grainger market architecture , like most in grainger town , which are either grade i or ii listed , was listed grade i in 1954 by english heritage
the climate in newcastle is oceanic \( k ppen cfb \) and significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude , due to the warming influence of the gulf stream \( via the north atlantic drift \) being in the rain shadow of the north pennines , it is among the driest cities in the uk temperature extremes recorded at newcastle weather centre include 32 5 c \( 90 5 f \) during august 1990 down to 12 6 c \( 9 3 f \) during january 1982 in contrast to other areas influenced by the gulf stream , such as inland scandinavia , newcastle has milder winters and cooler summers , similar to the remainder of the british isles
in 2010 , newcastle was positioned ninth in the retail centre expenditure league of the uk there are several major shopping areas in newcastle city centre the largest of these is the eldon square shopping centre , one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the uk it incorporates a flagship debenhams store as well as one of the largest john lewis stores in the uk john lewis is still known to many in newcastle as bainbridges newcastle store bainbridge 's , opened in 1838 , is often cited as the world s first department store emerson bainbridge \( 1817 1892 \) , a pioneer and the founder of bainbridges , sold goods via department , a new for merchant custom for that time the bainbridge s official ledgers reported revenue by department , giving birth to the name department store eldon square is currently undergoing a full redevelopment a new bus station , replacing the old underground bus station , was officially opened in march 2007 the wing of the centre , including the undercover green market , near grainger street was demolished in 2007 so that the area could be redeveloped this was completed in february 2010 with the opening of a flagship debenhams department store as well as other major stores including apple , hollister and guess
other shopping destinations in newcastle include grainger street and the area around grey 's monument , the relatively modern eldon garden and monument mall complexes , the newgate centre , central arcade and the traditional grainger market outside the city centre , the largest suburban shopping areas are gosforth and byker the largest tesco store in the united kingdom is located in kingston park on the edge of newcastle close to newcastle , the largest indoor shopping centre in europe , the metrocentre , is located in gateshead
the tyneside flat was the dominant housing form constructed at the time when the industrial centres on tyneside were growing most rapidly they can still be found in areas such as south heaton in newcastle but once dominated the streetscape on both sides of the tyne tyneside flats were built as terraces , one of each pair of doors led to an upstairs flat while the other led into the ground floor flat , each of two or three rooms a new development in the ouseburn valley has recreated them architects cany ash and robert sakula were attracted by the possibilities of high density without building high and getting rid of common areas
in terms of housing stock , the authority is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached homes rise in the 2010 census \( to 7 8 \) , in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments to 25 6 , and the proportion of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five colour coded brackets at 5 9 , and on a par with oxford and reading , greater than manchester and liverpool and below a handful of historic densely occupied , arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities harrogate , cheltenham , bath , inner london , hastings , brighton and tunbridge wells
according to the uk government 's returned 2001 census information , the city of newcastle had a population of 189 , 863 , whereas the metropolitan borough of newcastle had a population of around 259 , 000 newcastle has a population of 282 , 442 according to the office for national statistics the metropolitan boroughs of north tyneside \( population circa 201 , 000 \) , south tyneside \( population circa 148 , 000 \) and gateshead \( population circa 201 , 000 \) are , along with newcastle , all part of the tyneside conurbation \( population circa 880 , 000 \) the metropolitan county of tyne and wear , which consists of the four aforementioned boroughs as well as the city of sunderland \( population circa 275 , 000 \) , had a population of around 1 , 076 , 000 and the tyne and wear city region which also includes north durham , south east northumberland and the tyne valley has a population of 1 , 650 , 000 newcastle is also home to a large student population with newcastle and northumbria universities in the local area areas with predominant student populations include jesmond and heaton
according to the same statistics , the average age of people living in newcastle is 37 8 \( the national average being 38 6 \) many people in the city have scottish or irish ancestors there is a strong presence of border reiver surnames , such as armstrong , charlton , elliot , johnstone , kerr , hall , nixon , little and robson there are also small but significant chinese , jewish and eastern european \( polish , czech roma \) populations there are also estimated to be between 500 and 2 , 000 bolivians in newcastle , forming up to 1 of the population the largest such percentage of any uk city
the dialect of newcastle is known as geordie , and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive word pronunciations not used in other parts of the united kingdom the geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the anglo saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of england after the end of roman imperial rule this language was the forerunner of modern english but while the dialects of other english regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages particularly latin and norman french the geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language an example of this is the pronunciation of certain words dead , cow , house and strong are pronounced deed , coo , hoos and strang which is how they were pronounced in the anglo saxon language other geordie words with anglo saxon origins include larn \( from the anglo saxon laeran , meaning teach \) , burn \( stream \) and gan \( go \)
bairn and hyem , meaning child and home , respectively , are examples of geordie words with origins in scandinavia barn and hjem are the corresponding modern norwegian and danish words some words used in the geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the northern united kingdom the words bonny \( meaning pretty \) , howay \( come on \) , stot \( bounce \) and hadaway \( go away or you 're kidding \) , all appear to be used in scots aye \( yes \) and nowt \( ipa na t , rhymes with out , nothing \) are used elsewhere in northern england many words , however , appear to be used exclusively in newcastle and the surrounding area , such as canny \( a versatile word meaning good , nice or very \) , hacky \( dirty \) , netty \( toilet \) , hoy \( throw , from the dutch gooien , via west frisian \) , hockle \( spit \)
in a report , published in early february 2007 by the ear institute at the university college london , and widex , a danish hearing aid manufacturer , newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the uk , with an average level of 80 4 decibels the report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long term impact on the health of the city 's residents the report was criticized , however , for attaching too much weight to readings at arbitrarily selected locations , which in newcastle 's case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access
there are concentrations of pubs , bars and nightclubs around the bigg market and the quayside area of the city centre there are many bars on the bigg market , and other popular areas for nightlife are collingwood street , popularly referred to as the 'diamond strip' due to its concentration of high end bars , neville street , the central station area and osborne road in the jesmond area of the city in recent years the gate has opened in the city centre , a new indoor complex consisting of bars , upmarket clubs , restaurants and a 12 screen empire multiplex cinema newcastle 's gay scene 'the pink triangle' is centred on the times square area near the centre for life and has a range of bars , caf s and clubs

the official opening by queen victoria was on 22 june 1857 in the following year , late night openings were introduced , made possible by the use of gas lighting this was to enable in the words of cole to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry in these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of high art at the national gallery and scholarship at the british museum george wallis \( 1811 1891 \) , the first keeper of fine art collection , passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections this led to the transfer to the museum of the school of design that had been founded in 1837 at somerset house after the transfer it was referred to as the art school or art training school , later to become the royal college of art which finally achieved full independence in 1949 from the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of exhibition road in 1893 the science museum had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed

the victorian parts of the building have a complex history , with piecemeal additions by different architects founded in may 1852 , it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site this area of london was known as brompton but had been renamed south kensington the land was occupied by brompton park house , which was extended , most notably by the brompton boilers , which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the v a museum of childhood the first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the sheepshanks gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden its architect was civil engineer captain francis fowke , royal engineers , who was appointed by cole the next major expansions were designed by the same architect , the turner and vernon galleries built 1858 9 to house the eponymous collections \( later transferred to the tate gallery \) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively the north and south courts , were then built , both of which opened by june 1862 they now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the sheepshanks gallery on the very northern edge of the site is situated the secretariat wing , also built in 1862 this houses the offices and board room etc and is not open to the public
an ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas a series of mosaic figures depicting famous european artists of the medieval and renaissance period these have now been removed to other areas of the museum also started were a series of frescoes by lord leighton industrial arts as applied to war 1878 1880 and industrial arts applied to peace , which was started but never finished to the east of this were additional galleries , the decoration of which was the work of another designer owen jones , these were the oriental courts \( covering india , china and japan \) completed in 1863 , none of this decoration survives , part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century , opened in december 2006 the last work by fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden , this includes the refreshment rooms , reinstated as the museum caf in 2006 , with the silver gallery above , \( at the time the ceramics gallery \) , the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public the ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by f w moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery all the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864 69 the style adopted for this part of the museum was italian renaissance , much use was made of terracotta , brick and mosaic , this north fa ade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by james gamble reuben townroe having six panels depicting humphry davy \( chemistry \) isaac newton \( astronomy \) james watt \( mechanics \) bramante \( architecture \) michelangelo \( sculpture \) titian \( painting \) thus representing the range of the museums collections , godfrey sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the north fa ade commemorating the great exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum , this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by percival ball this building replaced brompton park house , which could then be demolished to make way for the south range
the interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers the green dining room 1866 68 was the work of philip webb and william morris , and displays elizabethan influences the lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure , with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained glass windows by edward burne jones the centre refreshment room 1865 77 was designed in a renaissance style by james gamble , the walls and even the ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile , the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained glass windows , the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by alfred stevens and was removed from dorchester house prior to that building 's demolition in 1929 the grill room 1876 81 was designed by sir edward poynter , the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling , above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the art school then based in the museum , the windows are also stained glass , there is an elaborate cast iron grill still in place
with the death of captain francis fowke , royal engineers the next architect to work at the museum was colonel \( later major general \) henry young darracott scott , also of the royal engineers he designed to the north west of the garden the five storey school for naval architects \( also known as the science schools \) , now the henry cole wing in 1867 72 scott 's assistant j w wild designed the impressive staircase that rises the full height of the building , made from cadeby stone the steps are 7 feet \( 2 1 m \) in length , the balustrades and columns are portland stone it is now used to jointly house the prints and architectural drawings of the v a \( prints , drawings , paintings and photographs \) and royal institute of british architects \( riba drawings and archives collections \) and the sackler centre for arts education , which opened in 2008
continuing the style of the earlier buildings , various designers were responsible for the decoration , the terracotta embellishments were again the work of godfrey sykes , although sgraffito was used to decorate the east side of the building designed by f w moody , a final embellishment were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by starkie gardner , these lead to a passage through the building scott also designed the two cast courts 1870 73 to the southeast of the garden \( the site of the brompton boilers \) , these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet \( 21 m \) in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings , including trajan 's column \( in two separate pieces \) the final part of the museum designed by scott was the art library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden , built 1877 83 , the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by reuben townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library , sir john taylor designed the book shelves and cases , also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting this completed the northern half of the site , creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre , but left the museum without a proper fa ade in 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum , with architect alfred waterhouse as one of the judges this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance
the main fa ade , built from red brick and portland stone , stretches 720 feet \( 220 m \) along cromwell gardens and was designed by aston webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum construction took place between 1899 and 1909 stylistically it is a strange hybrid , although much of the detail belongs to the renaissance there are medieval influences at work the main entrance consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier is romanesque in form but classical in detail likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame , a feature of late gothic architecture and a feature common in scotland , but the detail is classical the main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed , again a gothic feature , the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the british artists whose work is displayed in the museum
prince albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances , queen victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance , sculpted by alfred drury these fa ades surround four levels of galleries other areas designed by webb include the entrance hall and rotunda , the east and west halls , the areas occupied by the shop and asian galleries as well as the costume gallery the interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases , although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings , very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the victorian galleries , although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century

the american broadcasting company \( abc \) \( stylized in its logo as abc since 1957 \) is an american commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the disney abc television group , a subsidiary of disney media networks division of the walt disney company the network is part of the big three television networks the network is headquartered on columbus avenue and west 66th street in manhattan , with additional major offices and production facilities in new york city , los angeles and burbank , california
abc originally launched on october 12 , 1943 as a radio network , separated from and serving as the successor to the nbc blue network , which had been purchased by edward j noble it extended its operations to television in 1948 , following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks cbs and nbc in the mid 1950s , abc merged with united paramount theatres , a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of paramount pictures leonard goldenson , who had been the head of upt , made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series in the 1980s , after purchasing an 80 interest in cable sports channel espn , the network 's parent merged with capital cities communications , owner of several print publications , and television and radio stations in 1996 , most of capital cities abc 's assets were purchased by the walt disney company
the television network has eight owned and operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the united states and its territories most canadians have access to at least one u s based abc affiliate , either over the air \( in areas located within proximity to the canada united states border \) or through a cable , satellite or iptv provider , although most abc programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission that allow pay television providers to replace an american station 's signal with the feed of a canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue abc news provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by citadel broadcasting , which purchased the abc radio properties in 2007
in the 1930s , radio in the united states was dominated by three companies the columbia broadcasting system \( cbs \) , the mutual broadcasting system and the national broadcasting company \( nbc \) the last was owned by electronics manufacturer radio corporation of america \( rca \) , which owned two radio networks that each ran different varieties of programming , nbc blue and nbc red the nbc blue network was created in 1927 for the primary purpose of testing new programs on markets of lesser importance than those served by nbc red , which served the major cities , and to test drama series
in 1934 , mutual filed a complaint with the federal communications commission \( fcc \) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations , in a radio market that was already being saturated by nbc and cbs in 1938 , the fcc began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940 the report recommended that rca give up control of either nbc red or nbc blue at that time , the nbc red network was the principal radio network in the united states and , according to the fcc , rca was using nbc blue to eliminate any hint of competition having no power over the networks themselves , the fcc established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest
once mutual 's appeals against the fcc were rejected , rca decided to sell nbc blue in 1941 , and gave the mandate to do so to mark woods rca converted the nbc blue network into an independent subsidiary , formally divorcing the operations of nbc red and nbc blue on january 8 , 1942 , with the blue network being referred to on air as either blue or blue network the newly separated nbc red and nbc blue divided their respective corporate assets between 1942 and 1943 , woods offered to sell the entire nbc blue network , a package that included leases on landlines , three pending television licenses \( wjz tv in new york city , kgo tv in san francisco and wenr tv in chicago \) , 60 affiliates , four operations facilities \( in new york city , chicago , los angeles and washington d c \) , contracts with actors , and the brand associated with the blue network investment firm dillon , read co \( which was later acquired by the swiss bank corporation in 1997 \) offered 7 5 million to purchase the network , but the offer was rejected by woods and rca president david sarnoff
edward john noble , the owner of life savers candy , drugstore chain rexall and new york city radio station wmca , purchased the network for 8 million due to fcc ownership rules , the transaction , which was to include the purchase of three rca stations by noble , would require him to resell his station with the fcc 's approval the commission authorized the transaction on october 12 , 1943 soon afterward , the blue network was purchased by the new company noble founded , the american broadcasting system noble subsequently acquired the rights to the american broadcasting company name from george b storer in 1944 its parent company adopted the corporate name american broadcasting companies , inc woods retained his position as president and ceo of abc until december 1949 , and was subsequently promoted to vice chairman of the board before leaving abc altogether on june 30 , 1951
abc became an aggressive competitor to nbc and cbs when , continuing nbc blue 's traditions of public service , it aired symphony performances conducted by paul whiteman , performances from the metropolitan opera , and jazz concerts aired as part of its broadcast of the chamber music society of lower basin street announced by milton cross the network also became known for such suspenseful dramas as sherlock holmes , gang busters and counterspy , as well as several mid afternoon youth oriented programs however , abc made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming , with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of nbc and cbs , adopting the use of the magnetophon tape recorder , brought to the u s from nazi germany after its conquest , to pre record its programming with the help of the magnetophon , abc was able to provide its stars with greater freedom in terms of time , and also attract several big names , such as bing crosby at a time when nbc and cbs did not allow pre taped shows
a second period of international expansion is linked to that of the espn network in the 1990s , and policies enacted in the 2000s by disney media networks \( which included the expansion of several of the company 's u s based cable networks including disney channel and its spinoffs toon disney , playhouse disney and jetix although disney also sold its 33 stake in european sports channel eurosport for 155 million in june 2000 \) in contrast to disney 's other channels , abc is broadcast in the united states , although the network 's programming is syndicated in many countries the policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on september 27 of that year , abc announced the launch of abc1 , a free to air channel in the united kingdom owned by the abc group however , on september 8 , 2007 , disney announced that it would discontinue abc1 citing to the channel 's inability to attain sustainable viewership with abc1 's shutdown that october , the company 's attempt to develop abc international were discontinued
the idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels , and affiliates to rebroadcast the network 's programs in 1959 , this rerun activity was completed with program syndication , with abc films selling programs to networks not owned by abc the arrival of satellite television ended the need for abc to hold interests in other countries many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties as a result , abc was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks , mainly in japan and latin america , in the 1970s
the first attempts to internationalize the abc television network date back to the 1950s , after leonard goldenson , following the united paramount theatres model , tried to use on abc the same strategies he had made in expanding upt 's theater operation to the international market leonard goldenson said that abc 's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of queen elizabeth ii in june 1953 cbs and nbc were unable to cover the coronation live due to respective issues with technical problems and flight delays nbc 's plane landed in latin america where \? , leading abc to learn of subsidiaries in that region goldenson tried international investing , having abc invest in the latin american market , acquiring a 51 interest in a network covering central america goldenson also cited interest in japan in the early 1950s , acquiring a 5 stake in two new domestic networks , the mainichi broadcasting system in 1951 and nihon educational television in 1957 goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in beirut in the mid 1960s
abc currently holds the broadcast rights to the academy awards , emmy awards \( which are rotated across all four major networks on a year to year basis \) , american music awards , disney parks christmas day parade , tournament of roses parade , country music association awards and the cma music festival since 2000 , abc has also owned the television rights to most of the peanuts television specials , having acquired the broadcast rights from cbs , which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of a charlie brown christmas \( other peanuts specials broadcast annually by abc , including a charlie brown christmas , include it 's the great pumpkin , charlie brown and a charlie brown thanksgiving \)
since 1974 , abc has generally aired dick clark 's new year 's rockin' eve on new year 's eve \( hosted first by its creator dick clark , and later by his successor ryan seacrest \) the only exception was in 1999 , when abc put it on a one year hiatus to provide coverage of the international millennium festivities , though clark 's traditional countdown from times square was still featured within the coverage abc has also aired the miss america pageant from 1954 to 1956 , 1997 to 2005 \( with the television rights being assumed by cable channel tlc in 2006 , when the pageant moved from its longtime homebase in atlantic city to las vegas , before returning to atlantic city in 2013 \) and since 2011 under its current contract with the miss america organization , abc will continue to broadcast the pageant through 2016
abc 's daytime schedule currently features talk shows the view and the chew , and the soap opera general hospital , the latter of which is the longest running entertainment program in the history of the abc television network , having aired since 1963 abc also broadcasts the morning news program good morning america and has done so since 1975 , though that program is not considered to be part of the abc daytime block in addition to the long running all my children \( 1970 2011 \) and one life to live \( 1968 2012 \) , notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include ryan 's hope , dark shadows , loving , the city and port charles abc also aired the last nine years of the procter gamble produced soap the edge of night , following its cancellation by cbs in 1975 abc daytime has also aired a number of game shows , including the dating game , the newlywed game , let 's make a deal , password , split second , the 10 , 000 20 , 000 pyramid , family feud , the better sex , trivia trap , all star blitz and hot streak
sports programming is also provided on some weekend afternoons at any time from 12 00 to 6 00 p m eastern time \( 9 00 a m to 3 00 p m pacific \) and , during college football season , during prime time on saturday nights as part of the saturday night football package due to the erratic and \( outside of college football season \) highly inconsistent scheduling of sports programming on weekend afternoons since espn took over responsibilities for abc 's sports division in 2006 , abc carries the espn sports saturday block on saturday late afternoons \( featuring various espn produced documentaries \) , and on sundays either encores of primetime reality series , cancelled series being burned off that had no room on the primetime schedule , occasional theatrical films which were acquired by the network in the early to mid 2000s that no longer have a primetime slot to air in or more recently , figure skating and gymnastics specials supplied by disson skating , when no sports telecasts are scheduled , usually airing between 4 00 and 6 00 p m eastern and pacific time during the summer , abc airs espn produced highlight compilation programs for the open championship golf and the wimbledon tennis tournaments to provide some presence for both events on american broadcast television abc also carries various x games weekend events not broadcast by espn abc airs nba games on sundays , normally starting in january as nba sunday showcase during the regular season , and shows christmas day games , regularly between 2 7 pm et , and nba playoff games during the weekends , and exclusive rights to the nba finals
while its radio network was undergoing reconstruction , abc found it difficult to avoid falling behind on the new medium of television to ensure a space , in 1947 , abc submitted five applications for television station licenses , one for each market where it owned and operated a radio station \( new york city , los angeles , chicago , san francisco and detroit \) these applications all requested for the stations to broadcast on vhf channel 7 , as frank marx , then abc 's vice president of engineering , thought that the low band vhf frequencies \( corresponding to channels 2 through 6 \) would be requisitioned from broadcasting use and reallocated for the u s army
in the fall of 1949 , abc found itself in the position of an outsider , with less coverage than two of its competing networks , cbs and nbc , even though it was on par with them in some major cities and had a headstart over its third rival at the time , the dumont television network before the freeze ended in 1952 , there were only 108 existing television stations in the united states a few major cities \( such as boston \) had only two television stations , many other cities \( such as pittsburgh and st louis \) had only one , and still many others \( such as denver and portland \) did not yet have any television service the result was a strange period where television flourished in certain areas and network radio remained the main source of broadcast entertainment and news in others
at the end of 1949 , movie theater operator united paramount theatres \( upt \) was forced by the u s supreme court to become an independent entity , separating itself from paramount pictures for its part , abc was on the verge of bankruptcy , with only five owned and operated stations and nine full time affiliates its revenues , which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners viewers , failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations in 1951 , a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to cbs in 1951 , noble held a 58 ownership stake in abc , giving him 5 million with which to prevent abc from going bankrupt as banks refused further credit , that amount was obtained through a loan from the prudential insurance company of america
leonard goldenson , the president of upt \( which sought to diversify itself at the time \) , approached noble in 1951 on a proposal for upt to purchase abc noble received other offers , including one from cbs founder william s paley however , a merger with cbs would have forced that network to sell its new york city and los angeles stations at the very least goldenson and noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which upt would acquire abc and turn it into a subsidiary of the company that would retain autonomy in its management on june 6 , 1951 , the tentative agreement was approved by upt 's board of directors however , the transaction had to be approved by the fcc because of the presence of television networks and the recent separation between paramount and upt insofar as paramount pictures was already a shareholder in the dumont television network , the fcc conducted a series of hearings to ensure whether paramount was truly separated from united paramount theatres , and whether it was violating antitrust laws
in 1952 , when the release of the fcc 's sixth report and order announced the end of its freeze on new station license applications , among the issues the commission was slated to address was whether to approve the upt abc merger one fcc commissioner saw the possibility of abc , funded by upt , becoming a viable and competitive third television network on february 9 , 1953 , the fcc approved upt 's purchase of abc in exchange for 25 million in shares the merged company , renamed american broadcasting paramount theatres , inc and headquartered in the paramount building at 1501 broadway in manhattan , owned six am and several fm radio stations , five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 u s cities to comply with fcc ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market , upt sold its chicago television station , wbkb tv , to cbs \( which subsequently changed the station 's call letters to wbbm tv \) for 6 million , while it kept abc 's existing chicago station , wenr tv the merged company acquired the wbkb call letters for channel 7 , which would eventually become wls tv goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network
the network 's flagship owned and operated station , wjz tv in new york city \( later re called wabc tv \) , signed on the air on august 10 , 1948 , with its first broadcast running for two hours that evening abc 's other owned and operated stations launched over the course of the next 13 months wenr tv in chicago signed on the air on september 17 , while wxyz tv in detroit went on the air on october 9 , 1948 in october 1948 , as a result of an influx of television station license applications that it had issued as well as a study it undertook on the use of the vhf spectrum for broadcasting purposes , the fcc implemented a freeze on new station applications however , kgo tv in san francisco , which had received its license prior to the freeze , made its debut on may 5 , 1949 on may 7 , 1949 , billboard revealed that abc had proposed an investment of 6 25 million , of which it would spend 2 5 million to convert 20 acres \( 80 , 937 m2 \) of land in hollywood into what would become the prospect studios , and construct a transmitter on mount wilson , in anticipation of the launch of keca tv , which was scheduled to begin operations on august 1 \( but would not actually sign on until september 16 \)
the 1960s would be marked by the rise of family oriented series in an attempt by abc to counterprogram its established competitors , but the decade was also marked by the network 's gradual transition to color on september 30 , 1960 , abc premiered the flintstones , another example of counterprogramming although the animated series from william hanna and joseph barbera was filmed in color from the beginning , it was initially broadcast in black and white , as abc had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time the flintstones allowed abc to present a novelty , that of prime time animated programming , but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the disney partnership by carrying family oriented programming from other producers
in 1959 , walt disney productions , having improved its financial situation , had purchased abc 's shares in the disneyland theme park for 7 5 million and initiated discussions to renew abc 's television contract for walt disney presents , which was due to expire in 1961 walt disney was approached by nbc to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series \( which would be renamed walt disney 's wonderful world of color \) goldenson said abc could not counter the offer , because the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format as a result , abc and disney 's first television collaboration ended in 1961 \( the network would resume its relationship with disney in 1985 , when the anthology series returned to the network for a three season run as the disney sunday movie until it lost the rights to nbc again in 1988 the disney anthology series would return to abc in 1996 , following the company 's purchase of the future capital cities abc , as the wonderful world of disney \)
in 2000 , abc launched a web based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo , also called the dot , in which comic book character little dot prompted visitors to download the dot , a program which would cause the abc logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom right corner the network hired the troika design group to design and produce its 2001 02 identity , which continued using the black and yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots
in 1998 , the network began using a minimalist graphical identity , designed by pittard sullivan , featuring a small black and white abc circle logo on a yellow background \( promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night 's prime time lineup \) a new four note theme tune was introduced alongside the package , based around the network 's we love tv image campaign introduced that year , creating an audio signature on par with the nbc chimes , cbs' various three note soundmarks \( including the current version used since 2000 \) and the fox fanfare the four note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter \( though variants of it used since the 1998 99 season remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs \) in the fall of 2015 , abc is stopped with its 1998 2002 four note jingles for promotions and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs over seventeen years , now it have a different and adventure type music \( with the drums of the network 's four note signature in the ending \) the old four note theme tune is still used by abc on demand to the beginning of the abc show
in 1983 , for the 40th anniversary of the network 's founding , id sequences had the logo appear in a gold cgi design on a blue background , accompanied by the slogan that special feeling in a script font ten years later , in 1993 , the abc circle logo reverted to its classic white on black color scheme , but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters , and a bronze border surrounding the circle the abc logo first appeared as a on screen bug in the 1993 94 season , appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment , before appearing throughout programs \( except during commercial breaks \) beginning in the 1995 96 season the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011 12 season
the 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network in which based the logo 's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white , blue , pink , rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines among the abc circle logo 's many variants was a 1977 id sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters , and as such , was the first abc identification card to have a three dimensional appearance
in 1962 , graphic designer paul rand redesigned the abc logo into its best known \( and current \) form , with the lowercase letters abc enclosed in a single black circle the new logo debuted on air for abc 's promos at the start of the 1963 64 season the letters are strongly reminiscent of the bauhaus typeface designed by herbert bayer in the 1920s , but also share similarities with several other fonts , such as itc avant garde and horatio , and most closely resembling chalet the logo 's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate , which conferred a benefit for abc \( mostly before the advent of computer graphics \)
between may and september 2005 , rumors circulated that disney abc was considering a sale of abc radio , with clear channel communications and westwood one \( which had earlier purchased nbc 's radio division , as well as the distribution rights to cbs 's , and the mutual broadcasting system during the 1990s \) as potential buyers on october 19 , 2005 , abc announced the restructuring of the group into six divisions entertainment communications , communications resources , kids communications , news communications , corporate communications , and international communications
in 2004 , abc 's average viewership declined by ten ratings points , landing the network in fourth place , behind nbc , cbs and fox \( by the following year , the combined season ending average audience share of abc , nbc and cbs represented only 32 of u s households \) however , during the 2004 05 season , the network experienced unexpected success with new series such as desperate housewives , lost and grey 's anatomy as well as reality series dancing with the stars , which helped abc rise to second place , jumping ahead of cbs , but behind a surging fox on april 21 , 2004 , disney announced a restructuring of its disney media networks division with anne sweeney being named president of abc parent disney abc television group , and espn president george bodenheimer becoming co ceo of the division with sweeney , as well as president of abc sports on december 7 , 2005 , abc sports and espn signed an eight year broadcast rights agreement with nascar , allowing abc and espn to broadcast 17 nextel cup races each season \( comprising just over half of the 36 races held annually \) effective with the 2006 season

all of abc 's owned and operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios , but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming as a result , television series were produced by abc circle films beginning in 1962 and by touchstone television beginning in 1985 , before touchstone was reorganized as abc studios in february 2007 since the 1950s , abc has had two main production facilities the abc television center \( now the prospect studios \) on prospect avenue in hollywood , california , shared with the operations of kabc tv until 1999 and the abc television center , east , a set of studios located throughout the new york city
abc also owns the times square studios at 1500 broadway on land in times square owned by a development fund for the 42nd street project opened in 1999 , good morning america and nightline are broadcast from this particular facility abc news has premises a little further on west 66th street , in a six story building occupying a 196 feet \( 60 m \) 379 feet \( 116 m \) plot at 121 135 west end avenue the block of west end avenue housing the abc news building was renamed peter jennings way in 2006 in honor of the recently deceased longtime abc news chief anchor and anchor of world news tonight
abc maintains several video on demand services for delayed viewing of the network 's programming , including a traditional vod service called abc on demand , which is carried on most traditional cable and iptv providers the walt disney company is also a part owner of hulu \( as part of a consortium that includes , among other parties , the respective parent companies of nbc and fox , nbcuniversal and 21st century fox \) , and has offered full length episodes of most of abc 's programming through the streaming service since july 6 , 2009 \( which are available for viewing on hulu 's website and mobile app \) , as part of an agreement reached in april that year that also allowed disney to acquire a 27 ownership stake in hulu
the most recent episodes of the network 's shows are usually made available on watch abc , hulu and abc on demand the day after their original broadcast in addition , abc on demand \( like the video on demand television services provided by the other u s broadcast networks \) disallows fast forwarding of accessed content restrictions implemented by disney abc television group on january 7 , 2014 restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any abc program on hulu and watch abc until eight days after their initial broadcast , in order to encourage live or same week \( via both dvr and cable on demand \) viewing , with day after air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers \( such as comcast , verizon fios and time warner cable \) using an isp account via an authenticated user login
a revised version of the abc logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013 14 season during the network 's upfront presentation on may 14 , 2013 , and officially introduced on air on june 17 \( although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then \) , as part of an overhaul of abc 's identity by design agency loyalkaspar the updated logo carries a simpler gloss design than the previous version , and contains lettering more closely resembling paul rand 's original version of the circle logo the logo is displayed on air , online and in print advertising in four variants shading the respective color used with the circle design 's native black coloring a gold version is primarily used on entertainment oriented outlets \( such as abc com , watch abc , and by abc studios \) and the on screen bug steel blue and dark grey versions are used primarily by abc news a red version is used for espn on abc , while all four variants are used selectively in advertising and by affiliates a new custom typeface , abc modern \( which was inspired by the logotype \) , was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials
by 1954 , all u s networks had regained control of their programming , with higher advertising revenues abc 's revenue increased by 67 \( earning 26 million \) , nbc 's went up by 30 \( 100 million \) and cbs 's rose by 44 \( 117 million \) however that year , abc had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of cbs programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with nbc most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full time network affiliates in some markets that were large enough for a third full time affiliate , the only available commercial allocation was on the less desirable uhf band until the all channel receiver act \( passed by congress in 1961 \) mandated the inclusion of uhf tuning , most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch uhf stations , and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter additionally , during the analog television era , uhf stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain these factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a uhf station , especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network
as a result , with the exception of the largest markets , abc was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations , usually via off hours clearances \( a notable exception during this time was wkst tv in youngstown , ohio , now wytv , despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to cleveland and pittsburgh even decades before the city 's economic collapse \) according to goldenson , this meant that an hour of abc programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors however , the network 's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production still , abc 's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full time abc affiliate until the 1960s , with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s , which allowed stations like wtrf tv in wheeling , west virginia to begin airing abc programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network 's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before
on september 3 , 1958 , the disneyland anthology series was retitled walt disney presents as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name the movement in westerns , which abc is credited for having started , represented a fifth of all primetime series on american television in january 1959 , at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well abc requested additional productions from disney in late 1958 , desilu productions pitched its detective series the untouchables to cbs after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence , desilu then presented it to abc , which agreed to pick up the show , and debuted the untouchables in april 1959 the series went on to quickly become immensely popular
due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production , as the major networks began airing theatrically released films , abc joined cbs and nbc in broadcasting films on sunday nights in 1962 , with the launch of the abc sunday night movie , which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black and white despite a significant increase in viewership \( with its audience share having increased to 33 from the 15 share it had in 1953 \) , abc remained in third place the company had a total revenue of 15 5 million , a third of the revenue pulled in by cbs at the same period to catch up , abc followed up the flintstones with another animated series from hanna barbera , the jetsons , which debuted on september 23 , 1962 as the first television series to be broadcast in color on the network on april 1 , 1963 , abc debuted the soap opera general hospital , which would go on to become the television network 's long running entertainment program that year also saw the premiere of the fugitive \( on september 17 \) , a drama series centering on a man on the run after being accused of committing a murder he did not commit
on december 7 , 1965 , goldenson announced a merger proposal with itt to abc management the two companies agreed to the deal on april 27 , 1966 the fcc approved the merger on december 21 , 1966 however , the previous day \( december 20 \) , donald f turner , head antitrust regulator for the united states department of justice , expressed doubts related to such issues as the emerging cable television market , and concerns over the journalistic integrity of abc and how it could be influenced by the overseas ownership of itt itt management promised that the company would allow abc to retain autonomy in the publishing business the merger was suspended , and a complaint was filed by the department of justice in july 1967 , with itt going to trial in october 1967 the merger was officially canceled after the trial 's conclusion on january 1 , 1968
in december 1984 , thomas s murphy , chief executive officer of capital cities communications , contacted leonard goldenson about a proposal to merge their respective companies on march 16 , 1985 , abc 's executive committee accepted the merger offer , which was formally announced on march 18 , 1985 , with capital cities purchasing abc and its related properties for 3 5 billion and 118 for each of abc 's shares as well as a guarantee of 10 \( or 3 \) for a total of 121 per share to finance the purchase , capital cities borrowed 2 1 billion from a consortium of banks , which sold certain assets that capital cites could not acquire or retain due to fcc ownership rules for a combined 900 million and sold off several cable television systems , which were sold to the washington post company \( forming the present day cable one \) the remaining 500 million was loaned by warren buffett , who promised that his company berkshire hathaway would purchase 3 million in shares , at 172 50 apiece due to an fcc ban on same market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company \( although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the fcc in january 1985 , that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations \) , abc and capital cities respectively decided to sell wxyz tv and tampa independent station wfts tv to the e w scripps company \( although capital cities abc originally intended to seek a cross ownership waiver to retain wxyz and capital cities owned radio stations wjr and whyt \)
the merger between abc and capital cities received federal approval on september 5 , 1985 after the abc capital cities merger was finalized on january 3 , 1986 , the combined company which became known as capital cities abc , inc added four television stations \( wpvi tv philadelphia , ktrk tv houston , kfsn tv fresno and wtvd raleigh \) and several radio stations to abc 's broadcasting portfolio , and also included fairchild publications and four newspapers \( including the kansas city star and fort worth star telegram \) it also initiated several changes in its management frederick s pierce was named president of abc 's broadcasting division michael p millardi became vice president of abc broadcasting , and president of abc owned stations and abc video enterprises john b sias was appointed president of the abc television network brandon stoddard became president of abc entertainment \( a position to which he had been appointed in november 1985 \) and roone arledge became president of abc news and abc sports in february 1986 , thomas s murphy , who had been serving as ceo of capital cities since 1964 , was appointed chairman and ceo emeritus of abc jim duffy stepped down as abc television president for a management position at abc communications , a subsidiary that specialized in community service programming , including shows related to literary education
as far as programming is concerned , four of abc 's marquee shows of the 1970s ended their runs during the mid 1980s laverne shirley ended its run in 1983 , happy days and three 's company ended in 1984 \( with the latter producing a short lived spinoff that year \) , while the love boat ended its run in 1986 after nearly a decade of ratings trouble , nbc had regained the ratings lead among the big three networks in 1984 on the success of series such as the cosby show , cheers and miami vice to counteract nbc , abc decided to refocus itself on comedies and family oriented series beginning in the mid 1980s including mr belvedere , roseanne , who 's the boss \? , just the ten of us , the wonder years , full house and perfect strangers
following the initial success of these series , abc revamped its friday night schedule around family friendly comedies in the late 1980s , culminating in the 1989 debut of the tgif block \( which promotions referenced stood for thank goodness it 's funny \) many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by miller boyett productions , a warner bros based studio that briefly programmed the entire friday lineup during the 1990 91 season \( with going places joining family matters , full house and perfect strangers on the tgif schedule \) and through its development deal with paramount television prior to 1986 \( as miller milkis , and later , miller milkis boyett productions \) , had earlier produced happy days and its various spinoffs among other series for the network
in 1968 , abc took advantage of new fcc ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide in order to purchase houston radio stations kxyz and kxyz fm for 1 million in shares and 1 5 million in bonds that year , roone arledge was named president of abc sports the company also founded abc pictures , a film production company which released its first picture that year , the ralph nelson directed charly it was renamed abc motion pictures in 1979 the unit was dissolved in 1985 the studio also operated two subsidiaries , palomar pictures international and selmur pictures in july 1968 , abc continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of abc marine world in redwood city , california that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986 , with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of oracle corporation
it was not until the late 1950s that the abc network became a serious contender to nbc and cbs , and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public , such as westerns and detective series despite an almost 500 increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958 , the network only had a national reach of between 10 and 18 of the total u s population , as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than nbc and cbs in 1957 , abc entertainment president ollie treiz discovered that the locally produced variety show bandstand had pulled very strong ratings in the philadelphia market on wfil tv treiz ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national , under the revised title american bandstand the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to america 's youth and helped make a star out of its host , dick clark
these kinds of programs presented abc with an image of the philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors , offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks , which helped goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television abc 's western series \( as well as series such as the actioner zorro \) went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by nbc and cbs in the fall of 1957 , and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959 to captivate the network 's audiences , short 66 minute series were scheduled a half hour before their hour long competition in may 1961 , life criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law replacing the good programs with the bad ones
in may 2013 , abc launched watch abc , a revamp of its traditional multi platform streaming services encompassing the network 's existing streaming portal at abc com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers in addition to providing full length episodes of abc programs , the service allows live programming streams of local abc affiliates in select markets \( the first such offering by a u s broadcast network \) similar to sister network espn 's watchespn service \( which originated the watch brand used by the streaming services of disney 's television networks \) , live streams of abc stations are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers in certain markets new york city o o wabc tv and philadelphia o o wpvi tv were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service \( with a free preview for non subscribers through june 2013 \) , with the six remaining abc o os offering streams by the start of the 2013 14 season hearst television also reached a deal to offer streams of its abc affiliates \( including stations in boston , kansas city , milwaukee and west palm beach \) on the service
the sinclair broadcast group is the largest operator of abc stations by numerical total , owning or providing services to 28 abc affiliates and two additional subchannel only affiliates sinclair owns the largest abc subchannel affiliate by market size , wabm dt2 wdbb dt2 in the birmingham market , which serve as repeaters of wbma ld \( the largest low power big four affiliate by market size , which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former wbma satellite wgww , owned by sinclair partner company howard stirk holdings \) the e w scripps company is the largest operator of abc stations in terms of overall market reach , owning 15 abc affiliated stations \( including affiliates in larger markets such as cleveland , phoenix , detroit and denver \) , and through its ownership of phoenix affiliate knxv , las vegas affiliate ktnv tv and tucson affiliate kgun tv , the only provider of abc programming for the majority of arizona \( outside of the yuma el centro market \) and southern nevada
on june 16 , 2007 , abc began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007 08 season , start here also developed by troika , the on air design was intended to emphasize the availability of abc content across multiple platforms \( in particular , using a system of icons representing different devices , such as television , computers and mobile devices \) , and simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of abc the abc logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition , with a glossy ball effect that was specifically designed for hd on air , the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division , while blue ribbons were used for abc news
the network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in tampa , florida \( wfts tv and wwsb \) and grand rapids , michigan \( wzzm and wotv \) , with an analogous situation arising in kansas city , missouri \( kmbc tv and kqtv \) kqtv is licensed to st joseph , missouri , which is designated by nielsen as a separate market from kansas city despite being located within 55 miles \( 89 km \) of one another , while wwsb and wotv serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market 's primary abc affiliate \( in the case of wwsb , this dates back to when wtsp was tampa 's primary abc affiliate prior to 1994 , with the former being necessitated to serve the southern part of the tampa market including the station 's city of license , sarasota , due to wtsp 's transmitter being short spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of miami affiliate wplg which like wtsp , broadcast on vhf channel 10 \)
he came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of northeast asia after founding the mongol empire and being proclaimed genghis khan , he started the mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of eurasia these included raids or invasions of the qara khitai , caucasus , khwarezmid empire , western xia and jin dynasties these campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations especially in the khwarezmian and xia controlled lands by the end of his life , the mongol empire occupied a substantial portion of central asia and china
before genghis khan died , he assigned gedei khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons he died in 1227 after defeating the western xia he was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in mongolia at an unknown location his descendants extended the mongol empire across most of eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states out of all of modern day china , korea , the caucasus , central asia , and substantial portions of modern eastern europe , russia , and southwest asia many of these invasions repeated the earlier large scale slaughters of local populations as a result , genghis khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories
tem jin was probably born in 1162 in del n boldog , near burkhan khaldun mountain and the onon and kherlen rivers in modern day northern mongolia , not far from the current capital ulaanbaatar the secret history of the mongols reports that tem jin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist , a traditional sign that he was destined to become a great leader he was the second oldest son of his father yes gei , a khamag mongol 's major chief of the kiyad and an ally of toghrul khan of the keraite tribe , and the oldest son of his mother hoelun according to the secret history , tem jin was named after a tatar chieftain , tem jin ge , whom his father had just captured
tem jin had three brothers named hasar , hachiun , and tem ge , and one sister named tem len , as well as two half brothers named begter and belgutei like many of the nomads of mongolia , tem jin 's early life was difficult his father arranged a marriage for him , and at nine years of age he was delivered by his father to the family of his future wife b rte , who was a member of the tribe khongirad tem jin was to live there in service to dai setsen , the head of the new household , until he reached the marriageable age of 12
for the next several years , hoelun and her children lived in poverty , surviving primarily on wild fruits and ox carcasses , marmots , and other small game killed by tem jin and his brothers begter , temujin 's older half brother , began to exercise the power of the eldest male in the family and eventually temujin 's mother hoelun \( not begter 's mother \) would have to accept him as her husband if and when he became an adult temujin 's resentment erupted during one hunting excursion that tem jin and his brother khasar killed their half brother begter
in another incident , around 1177 , he was captured in a raid and held prisoner by his father 's former allies , the tayichi'ud the tayichi'ud enslaved tem jin \( reportedly with a cangue , a sort of portable stocks \) , but with the help of a sympathetic guard , the father of chilaun \( who later became a general of genghis khan \) , he was able to escape from the ger \( yurt \) in the middle of the night by hiding in a river crevice citation needed it was around this time that jelme and bo'orchu , two of genghis khan 's future generals , joined forces with him tem jin 's reputation also became widespread after his escape from the tayichi'ud
at this time , none of the tribal confederations of mongolia were united politically , and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances tem jin grew up observing the tough political climate of mongolia , which included tribal warfare , thievery , raids , corruption , and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations , all compounded by interference from foreign forces such as the chinese dynasties to the south tem jin 's mother hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of mongolia , especially the need for alliances
as previously arranged by his father , tem jin married b rte of the onggirat tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their respective tribes soon after b rte 's marriage to tem jin , she was kidnapped by the merkits and reportedly given away as a wife tem jin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival , jamukha , and his protector , toghrul khan of the keraite tribe she gave birth to a son , jochi \( 1185 1226 \) , nine months later , clouding the issue of his parentage despite speculation over jochi , b rte would be tem jin 's only empress , though he did follow tradition by taking several morganatic wives
b rte had three more sons , chagatai \( 1187 1241 \) , gedei \( 1189 1241 \) , and tolui \( 1190 1232 \) genghis khan also had many other children with his other wives , but they were excluded from the succession while the names of sons were documented , daughters were not the names of at least six daughters are known , and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime , no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of genghis khan
tem jin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally \( or , according to other sources , a vassal \) to his father 's anda \( sworn brother or blood brother \) toghrul , who was khan of the keraites , and is better known by the chinese title wang khan , which the jurchen jin dynasty granted him in 1197 this relationship was first reinforced when b rte was captured by the merkits tem jin turned to toghrul for support , and in response , toghrul offered his vassal 20 , 000 of his keraite warriors and suggested that he also involve his childhood friend jamukha , who had himself become khan \( ruler \) of his own tribe , the jadaran
as jamukha and tem jin drifted apart in their friendship , each began consolidating power , and soon became rivals jamukha supported the traditional mongolian aristocracy , while tem jin followed a meritocratic method , and attracted a broader , though lower class , range of followers due to his earlier defeat of the merkits , and a proclamation by the shaman kokochu that the eternal blue sky had set aside the world for tem jin , tem jin began rising to power in 1186 , tem jin was elected khan of the mongols however , jamukha , threatened by tem jin 's rapid ascent , quickly moved to stop tem jin 's ambitions in 1187 , he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops tem jin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack , but he was decisively beaten in the battle of dalan balzhut jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons , alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for tem jin toghrul , as tem jin 's patron , was exiled to the qara khitai the life of tem jin for the next ten years is very unclear , as historical records are mostly silent on that period
as an incentive for absolute obedience and following his rule of law , the yassa code , tem jin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils as he defeated rival tribes , he did not drive away enemy soldiers and abandon the rest instead , he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe he would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe , bringing them into his family these political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people , making tem jin stronger with each victory
one of the later ruptures between toghrul and tem jin was toghrul 's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to jochi , the eldest son of tem jin , a sign of disrespect in the mongolian culture this act led to the split between both factions and was a prelude to war toghrul allied himself with jamukha , who already opposed tem jin 's forces however , the internal dispute between toghrul and jamukha , plus the desertion of a number of their allies to tem jin , led to toghrul 's defeat jamukha escaped during the conflict this defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the keraite tribe
the next direct threat to tem jin was the naimans \( naiman mongols \) , with whom jamukha and his followers took refuge the naimans did not surrender , although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with tem jin in 1201 , a khuruldai elected jamukha as g r khan , universal ruler , a title used by the rulers of the qara khitai jamukha 's assumption of this title was the final breach with tem jin , and jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him before the conflict , however , several generals abandoned jamukha , including subutai , jelme 's well known younger brother after several battles , jamukha was finally turned over to tem jin by his own men in 1206
according to the secret history , tem jin again offered his friendship to jamukha , asking him to return to his side tem jin had killed the men who betrayed jamukha , stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion , saying that there can only be one sun in the sky , and he asked for a noble death the custom is to die without spilling blood , which is granted by breaking the back jamukha requested this form of death , despite the fact that in the past jamukha had been known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive
accounts of genghis khan 's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies these include rifts with his early allies such as jamukha \( who also wanted to be a ruler of mongol tribes \) and wang khan \( his and his father 's ally \) , his son jochi , and problems with the most important shaman , who was allegedly trying to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother khasar his military strategies showed a deep interest in gathering good intelligence and understanding the motivations of his rivals , exemplified by his extensive spy network and yam route systems he seemed to be a quick student , adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered , such as siege warfare from the chinese he was also ruthless , demonstrated by his tactic of measuring against the linchpin , used against the tribes led by jamukha
as a result , by 1206 tem jin had managed to unite or subdue the merkits , naimans , mongols , keraites , tatars , uyghurs , and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule it was a monumental feat for the mongols \( as they became known collectively \) at a khuruldai , a council of mongol chiefs , tem jin was acknowledged as khan of the consolidated tribes and took the new title genghis khan the title khagan was not conferred on genghis until after his death , when his son and successor , gedei , took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father \( as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the yuan dynasty \) this unification of all confederations by genghis khan established peace between previously warring tribes and a single political and military force under genghis khan
in 1211 , after the conquest of western xia , genghis khan planned again to conquer the jin dynasty the commander of the jin dynasty army made a tactical mistake in not attacking the mongols at the first opportunity instead , the jin commander sent a messenger , ming tan , to the mongol side , who defected and told the mongols that the jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass at this engagement fought at badger pass the mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of jin troops in 1215 genghis besieged , captured , and sacked the jin capital of zhongdu \( modern day beijing \) this forced the emperor xuanzong to move his capital south to kaifeng , abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the mongols between 1232 and 1233 , kaifeng fell to the mongols under the reign of genghis' third son , gedei khan the jin dynasty collapsed in 1234 , after the siege of caizhou
kuchlug , the deposed khan of the naiman confederation that tem jin defeated and folded into his mongol empire , fled west and usurped the khanate of qara khitai \( also known as the western liao , as it was originally established as remnants of the liao dynasty \) genghis khan decided to conquer the qara khitai and defeat kuchlug , possibly to take him out of power by this time the mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in china against the western xia and jin dynasty therefore , genghis sent only two tumen \( 20 , 000 soldiers \) against kuchlug , under his younger general , jebe , known as the arrow
with such a small force , the invading mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among kuchlug 's supporters , leaving the qara khitai more vulnerable to mongol conquest as a result , kuchlug 's army was defeated west of kashgar kuchlug fled again , but was soon hunted down by jebe 's army and executed by 1218 , as a result of defeat of qara khitai , the mongol empire and its control extended as far west as lake balkhash , which bordered the khwarezmia \( khwarezmid empire \) , a muslim state that reached the caspian sea to the west and persian gulf and the arabian sea to the south
in the early 13th century , the khwarazmian dynasty was governed by shah ala ad din muhammad genghis khan saw the potential advantage in khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the silk road , and he initially sent a 500 man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire however , inalchuq , the governor of the khwarezmian city of otrar , attacked the caravan that came from mongolia , claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against khwarezmia the situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators genghis khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors \( two mongols and a muslim \) to meet the shah himself instead of the governor inalchuq the shah had all the men shaved and the muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors this was seen as an affront and insult to genghis khan outraged , genghis khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100 , 000 soldiers \( 10 tumens \) , his most capable generals and some of his sons he left a commander and number of troops in china , designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to khwarezmia
the mongol army under genghis khan , generals and his sons crossed the tien shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the khwarezmian empire after compiling intelligence from many sources genghis khan carefully prepared his army , which was divided into three groups his son jochi led the first division into the northeast of khwarezmia the second division under jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of khwarzemia to form , with the first division , a pincer attack on samarkand the third division under genghis khan and tolui marched to the northwest and attacked khwarzemia from that direction
the shah 's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the shah 's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities this fragmentation was decisive in khwarezmia 's defeats , as it allowed the mongols , although exhausted from the long journey , to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense the mongol army quickly seized the town of otrar , relying on superior strategy and tactics genghis khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians , enslaved the rest of the population and executed inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes , as retribution for his actions near the end of the battle the shah fled rather than surrender genghis khan ordered subutai and jebe to hunt him down , giving them 20 , 000 men and two years to do this the shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire
the mongols' conquest , even by their own standards , was brutal after the capital samarkand fell , the capital was moved to bukhara by the remaining men , while genghis khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the khwarezmid empire , including not only royal buildings , but entire towns , populations , and even vast swaths of farmland according to legend , genghis khan even went so far as to divert a river through the khwarezmid emperor 's birthplace , erasing it from the map citation needed
the mongols attacked samarkand using captured enemies as body shields after several days only a few remaining soldiers , loyal supporters of the shah , held out in the citadel after the fortress fell , genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at samarkand the people of samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city , where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory ata malik juvayni , a high official in the service of the mongol empire , wrote that in termez , on the oxus , all the people , both men and women , were driven out onto the plain , and divided in accordance with their usual custom , then they were all slain
the city of bukhara was not heavily fortified , with a moat and a single wall , and the citadel typical of khwarezmi cities the city leaders opened the gates to the mongols , though a unit of turkish defenders held the city 's citadel for another twelve days survivors from the citadel were executed , artisans and craftsmen were sent back to mongolia , young men who had not fought were drafted into the mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery as the mongol soldiers looted the city , a fire broke out , razing most of the city to the ground genghis khan had the city 's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town , where he declared that he was the flail of god , sent to punish them for their sins
after the defeat of the khwarezmian empire in 1220 , genghis khan gathered his forces in persia and armenia to return to the mongolian steppes under the suggestion of subutai , the mongol army was split into two forces genghis khan led the main army on a raid through afghanistan and northern india towards mongolia , while another 20 , 000 \( two tumen \) contingent marched through the caucasus and into russia under generals jebe and subutai they pushed deep into armenia and azerbaijan the mongols destroyed the kingdom of georgia , sacked the genoese trade fortress of caffa in crimea and overwintered near the black sea heading home , subutai 's forces attacked the allied forces of the cuman kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80 , 000 kievan rus' troops led by mstislav the bold of halych and mstislav iii of kiev who went out to stop the mongols' actions in the area subutai sent emissaries to the slavic princes calling for a separate peace , but the emissaries were executed at the battle of kalka river in 1223 , subutai 's forces defeated the larger kievan force they also may have fought against the neighboring volga bulgars there is no historical record except a short account by the arab historian ibn al athir , writing in mosul some 1100 miles away from the event various historical secondary sources morgan , chambers , grousset state that the mongols actually defeated the bulgars , chambers even going so far as to say that the bulgars had made up stories to tell the \( recently crushed \) russians that they had beaten the mongols and driven them from their territory the russian princes then sued for peace subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes as was customary in mongol society for nobility , the russian princes were given a bloodless death subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals six russian princes , including mstislav iii of kiev , were put under this platform and crushed to death
the mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the bulgar territory , allowing for the planning for conquest of hungary and europe genghis khan recalled subutai back to mongolia soon afterwards , and jebe died on the road back to samarkand the famous cavalry expedition led by subutai and jebe , in which they encircled the entire caspian sea defeating all armies in their path , remains unparalleled to this day , and word of the mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations , particularly europe these two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions in 1225 both divisions returned to mongolia these invasions added transoxiana and persia to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way later under genghis khan 's grandson batu and the golden horde , the mongols returned to conquer volga bulgaria and kievan rus' in 1237 , concluding the campaign in 1240
in 1226 , immediately after returning from the west , genghis khan began a retaliatory attack on the tanguts his armies quickly took heisui , ganzhou , and suzhou \( not the suzhou in jiangsu province \) , and in the autumn he took xiliang fu disambiguation needed one of the tangut generals challenged the mongols to a battle near helan mountains but was defeated in november , genghis laid siege to the tangut city lingzhou and crossed the yellow river , defeating the tangut relief army according to legend , it was here that genghis khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory
in 1227 , genghis khan 's army attacked and destroyed the tangut capital of ning hia and continued to advance , seizing lintiao fu , xining province , xindu fu , and deshun province in quick succession in the spring at deshun , the tangut general ma jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate ma jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle genghis khan , after conquering deshun , went to liupanshan \( qingshui county , gansu province \) to escape the severe summer the new tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the mongols , and the rest of the tanguts officially surrendered soon after not happy with their betrayal and resistance , genghis khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed , effectively ending the tangut lineage
the succession of genghis khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign , as he reached old age the long running paternity discussion about genghis' oldest son jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of jochi among the brothers according to traditional historical accounts , the issue over jochi 's paternity was voiced most strongly by chagatai in the secret history of the mongols , just before the invasion of the khwarezmid empire by genghis khan , chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept jochi as genghis khan 's successor in response to this tension , and possibly for other reasons , gedei was appointed as successor
genghis khan was aware of the friction between his sons \( particularly between chagatai and jochi \) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died he therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them khan in their own right , while appointing one of his sons as his successor chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior , because of statements he made that he would not follow jochi if he were to become his father 's successor tolui , genghis khan 's youngest son , was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the mongol culture , youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age if jochi were to become successor , it was likely that chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire therefore , genghis khan decided to give the throne to gedei gedei was seen by genghis khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers
jochi died in 1226 , during his father 's lifetime some scholars , notably ratchnevsky , have commented on the possibility that jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from genghis khan rashid al din reports that the great khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223 , and while his brothers heeded the order , jochi remained in khorasan juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between jochi and his brothers in the siege of urgench jochi had attempted to protect urgench from destruction , as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief he concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by jochi genghis khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands i would be doing a service if i killed my father when he is hunting , made an alliance with sultan muhammad , brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the muslims juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that genghis khan ordered his son secretly poisoned however , as sultan muhammad was already dead in 1223 , the accuracy of this story is questionable
in august 1227 , during the fall of yinchuan , the capital of western xia , genghis khan died the exact cause of his death remains a mystery , and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the western xia , illness , falling from his horse , or wounds sustained in hunting or battle according to the secret history of the mongols genghis khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury he was already old and tired from his journeys the galician volhynian chronicle alleges he was killed by the western xia in battle , while marco polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign later mongol chronicles connect genghis' death with a western xia princess taken as war booty one chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him , though some mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival oirads
years before his death , genghis khan asked to be buried without markings , according to the customs of his tribe after he died , his body was returned to mongolia and presumably to his birthplace in khentii aimag , where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the onon river and the burkhan khaldun mountain \( part of the kentii mountain range \) according to legend , the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried the genghis khan mausoleum , constructed many years after his death , is his memorial , but not his burial site
in 1939 chinese nationalist soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'lord 's enclosure' \( mongolian edsen khoroo \) in mongolia to protect it from japanese troops it was taken through communist held territory in yan'an some 900 km on carts to safety at a buddhist monastery , the dongshan dafo dian , where it remained for ten years in 1949 , as communist troops advanced , the nationalist soldiers moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous tibetan monastery of kumbum monastery or ta'er shi near xining , which soon fell under communist control in early 1954 , genghis khan 's bier and relics were returned to the lord 's enclosure in mongolia by 1956 a new temple was erected there to house them in 1968 during the cultural revolution , red guards destroyed almost everything of value the relics were remade in the 1970s and a great marble statue of genghis was completed in 1989
on october 6 , 2004 , a joint japanese mongolian archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be genghis khan 's palace in rural mongolia , which raises the possibility of actually locating the ruler 's long lost burial site folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find \( the same manner of burial as the sumerian king gilgamesh of uruk and atilla the hun \) other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses , and that trees were then planted over the site , and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site
the mongol empire was governed by a civilian and military code , called the yassa , created by genghis khan the mongol empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race in the administrative realm , instead adopting an approach grounded in meritocracy the exception was the role of genghis khan and his family the mongol empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history , as befitted its size many of the empire 's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves mongols in military and civilian life , including mongols , turks and others and included many diverse khans of various ethnicities as part of the mongol empire such as muhammad khan
there were tax exemptions for religious figures and , to some extent , teachers and doctors the mongol empire practiced religious tolerance because mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept , and not subject to law or interference citation needed sometime before the rise of genghis khan , ong khan , his mentor and eventual rival , had converted to nestorian christianity various mongol tribes were shamanist , buddhist or christian religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the asian steppe
modern mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life , genghis khan attempted to create a civil state under the great yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals , including women however , there is no evidence of this , or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the chinese women played a relatively important role in mongol empire and in family , for example t regene khatun was briefly in charge of the mongol empire when next male khagan was being chosen modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the pax mongolica \( mongol peace \)
genghis khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him he also realised that such administrators could not be found among his mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities for this purpose genghis khan invited a khitan prince , chu'tsai , who worked for the jin and had been captured by the mongol army after the jin dynasty was defeated jin had captured power by displacing khitan genghis told chu'tsai , who was a lineal descendant of khitan rulers , that he had avenged chu'tsai 's forefathers chu'tsai responded that his father served the jin dynasty honestly and so did he also he did not consider his own father his enemy , so the question of revenge did not apply this reply impressed genghis khan chu'tsai administered parts of the mongol empire and became a confidant of the successive mongol khans
genghis khan put absolute trust in his generals , such as muqali , jebe and subutai , and regarded them as close advisors , often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members he allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the mongol empire capital karakorum muqali , a trusted lieutenant , was given command of the mongol forces against the jin dynasty while genghis khan was fighting in central asia , and subutai and jebe were allowed to pursue the great raid into the caucasus and kievan rus' , an idea they had presented to the khagan on their own initiative while granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions , genghis khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them
the mongol military was also successful in siege warfare , cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers , taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army , and adopting new ideas , techniques and tools from the people they conquered , particularly in employing muslim and chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the mongol cavalry in capturing cities another standard tactic of the mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack
contrary to popular belief , genghis khan did not conquer all the areas ultimately part of the mongol empire at the time of his death , the mongol empire stretched from the caspian sea to the sea of japan the empire 's expansion continued for a generation or more after genghis 's death in 1227 under genghis 's successor gedei khan the speed of expansion reached its peak mongol armies pushed into persia , finished off the western xia and the remnants of the khwarezmids , and came into conflict with the imperial song dynasty of china , starting a war that lasted until 1279 and that concluded with the mongols gaining control of all of china they also pushed further into russia and eastern europe
genghis khan is credited with bringing the silk road under one cohesive political environment this allowed increased communication and trade between the west , middle east and asia , thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas some historians have noted that genghis khan instituted certain levels of meritocracy in his rule , was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers in turkey , genghis khan is looked on as a great military leader , and it is popular for male children to carry his title as name
in the early 1990s the memory of genghis khan with the mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the mongolian people 's republic period genghis khan became one of the central figures of the national identity he is looked upon positively by mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes for example , it is not uncommon for mongolians to refer to their country as genghis khan 's mongolia , to themselves as genghis khan 's children , and to genghis khan as the father of the mongols especially among the younger generation however , there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non mongolians are unfairly biased against genghis khan and that his butchery is exaggerated , while his positive role is underrated
in mongolia today , genghis khan 's name and likeness are endorsed on products , streets , buildings , and other places his face can be found on everyday commodities , from liquor bottles to candy products , and on the largest denominations of 500 , 1 , 000 , 5 , 000 , 10 , 000 , and 20 , 000 mongolian t gr g \( \) mongolia 's main international airport in ulaanbaatar is named chinggis khaan international airport major genghis khan statues have been erected before the parliament and near ulaanbaatar there have been repeated discussions about regulating the use of his name and image to avoid trivialization
genghis khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in mongolia 's history he is responsible for the emergence of the mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity he reinforced many mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes he is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional mongolian script and the creation of the ikh zasag \( great administration \) , the first written mongolian law ikh zasag law adopted during genghis khan s time in mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily , mongolian president tsakhiagiin elbegdorj noted president elbegdorj sees genghis khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti corruption efforts as genghis khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth chinggis \( genghis khan \) was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law , and not with the distinctions between people he was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces , elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of chinggis khaan 's birth in summary , mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the mongol empire and therefore the basis for mongolia as a country
there are conflicting views of genghis khan in the people 's republic of china with some viewing him positively in the inner mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million , almost twice the population of mongolia while genghis khan never conquered all of china , his grandson kublai khan completed that conquest and established the yuan dynasty that is often credited with re uniting china there has been much artwork and literature praising genghis as a great military leader and political genius the years of the mongol established yuan dynasty left an indelible imprint on chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the jin dynasty relatively fewer in general the legacy of genghis khan and his successors , who completed the conquest of china after 65 years of struggle , remains a mixed topic citation needed
in the middle east , and particularly in iran , genghis khan is almost universally condemned as a destructive and genocidal warlord who caused enormous damage and destruction to the population of these areas steven r ward wrote that overall , the mongol violence and depredations killed up to three fourths of the population of the iranian plateau , possibly 10 to 15 million people some historians have estimated that iran 's population did not again reach its pre mongol levels until the mid 20th century
the invasions of baghdad , samarkand , urgench , kiev , vladimir among others caused mass murders , such as when portions of southern khuzestan were completely destroyed his descendant hulagu khan destroyed much of iran 's northern part and sacked baghdad although his forces were halted by the mamluks of egypt , but hulagu 's descendant ghazan khan would return to beat the egyptian mamluks right out of levant , palestine and even gaza according to the works of the persian historian rashid al din hamadani , the mongols killed more than 70 , 000 people in merv and more than 190 , 000 in nishapur in 1237 batu khan , a grandson of genghis khan , launched an invasion into kievan rus' over the course of three years , the mongols destroyed and annihilated all of the major cities of eastern europe with the exceptions of novgorod and pskov
although the famous mughal emperors were proud descendants of genghis khan and particularly timur , they clearly distanced themselves from the mongol atrocities committed against the khwarizim shahs , turks , persians , the citizens of baghdad and damascus , nishapur , bukhara and historical figures such as attar of nishapur and many other notable muslims however , mughal emperors directly patronized the legacies of genghis khan and timur together their names were synonymous with the names of other distinguished personalities particularly among the muslim populations of south asia
one theory suggests the name stems from a palatalised version of the mongolian and turkic word tenggis , meaning ocean , oceanic or wide spreading \( lake baikal and ocean were called tenggis by the mongols however , it seems that if they had meant to call genghis tenggis they could have said , and written , tenggis khan , which they did not \) zh ng \( chinese \) meaning right , just , or true , would have received the mongolian adjectival modifier s , creating jenggis , which in medieval romanization would be written genghis it is likely that the 13th century mongolian pronunciation would have closely matched chinggis
genghis khan , the title is spelled in variety of ways in different languages such as mongolian chinggis khaan , english chinghiz , chinghis , and chingiz , chinese pinyin ch ngj s h n , turkic cengiz han , ingiz xan , ingiz han , chingizxon , z xan , chengez khan , chinggis khan , chinggis xaan , chingis khan , jenghis khan , chinggis qan , djingis kahn , russian \( ingiskhan \) or \( ingiz khan \) , etc tem jin is written in chinese as simplified chinese traditional chinese pinyin ti m zh n
the word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th 17th centuries however , the original greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison in addition to pharma responsibilities , the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners , such as surgery and midwifery the pharma \( as it was referred to \) often operated through a retail shop which , in addition to ingredients for medicines , sold tobacco and patent medicines often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term , though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy , in english the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent the pharmas also used many other herbs not listed the greek word pharmakeia \( greek \) derives from pharmakon \( \) , meaning drug , medicine \( or poison \) n 1
pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines pharmacists may also be small business proprietors , owning the pharmacy in which they practice since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug , and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail , they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual
a pharmacy technician in the uk is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist \( if employed in a hospital pharmacy \) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians in the uk the role of a pht has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research a pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the general pharmaceutical council \( gphc \) register the gphc is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
in ancient greece , diocles of carystus \( 4th century bc \) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants he wrote several treatises on the topic the greek physician pedanius dioscorides is famous for writing a five volume book in his native greek in the 1st century ad the latin translation de materia medica \( concerning medical substances \) was used a basis for many medieval texts , and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the islamic golden age the title coined the term materia medica
in japan , at the end of the asuka period \( 538 710 \) and the early nara period \( 710 794 \) , the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected the place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the taih code \( 701 \) and re stated in the y r code \( 718 \) ranked positions in the pre heian imperial court were established and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the meiji restoration \( 1868 \) in this highly stable hierarchy , the pharmacists and even pharmacist assistants were assigned status superior to all others in health related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists in the imperial household , the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the emperor
the advances made in the middle east in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval islam substantially to develop pharmacology muhammad ibn zakar ya r zi \( rhazes \) \( 865 915 \) , for instance , acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds abu al qasim al zahrawi \( abulcasis \) \( 936 1013 \) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation his liber servitoris is of particular interest , as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used sabur ibn sahl \( d 869 \) , was , however , the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia , describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments al biruni \( 973 1050 \) wrote one of the most valuable islamic works on pharmacology , entitled kitab al saydalah \( the book of drugs \) , in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist avicenna , too , described no less than 700 preparations , their properties , modes of action , and their indications he devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in the canon of medicine of great impact were also the works by al maridini of baghdad and cairo , and ibn al wafid \( 1008 1074 \) , both of which were printed in latin more than fifty times , appearing as de medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'mesue' the younger , and the medicamentis simplicibus by 'abenguefit' peter of abano \( 1250 1316 \) translated and added a supplement to the work of al maridini under the title de veneris al muwaffaq s contributions in the field are also pioneering living in the 10th century , he wrote the foundations of the true properties of remedies , amongst others describing arsenious oxide , and being acquainted with silicic acid he made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate , and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds , especially copper vitriol , and also lead compounds he also describes the distillation of sea water for drinking verification needed
in europe there are old pharmacies still operating in dubrovnik , croatia , located inside the franciscan monastery , opened in 1317 and in the town hall square of tallinn , estonia , dating from at least 1422 the oldest is claimed to have been set up in 1221 in the church of santa maria novella in florence , italy , which now houses a perfume museum the medieval esteve pharmacy , located in ll via , a catalan enclave close to puigcerd , also now a museum , dates back to the 15th century , keeping albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries , old prescription books and antique drugs
in most countries , the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation with requirements for storage conditions , compulsory texts , equipment , etc , specified in legislation where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding dispensing medications , there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues
because of the complexity of medications including specific indications , effectiveness of treatment regimens , safety of medications \( i e , drug interactions \) and patient compliance issues \( in the hospital and at home \) many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy for example , there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology oncology , hiv aids , infectious disease , critical care , emergency medicine , toxicology , nuclear pharmacy , pain management , psychiatry , anti coagulation clinics , herbal medicine , neurology epilepsy management , pediatrics , neonatal pharmacists and more
hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications , including more specialized medications , than would be feasible in the community setting most hospital medications are unit dose , or a single dose of medicine hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition \( tpn \) , and other medications given intravenously this is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel , quality assurance of products , and adequate facilities several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding the high cost of medications and drug related technology , combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient care outcomes and patient safety , make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible
pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health , wellness , and disease prevention clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings , but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care they often participate in patient care rounds drug product selection
the clinical pharmacist 's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient specific problems , identifying goals of therapy , and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient the review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy \( e g , drug choice , dose , route , frequency , and duration of therapy \) and its efficacy the pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions , adverse drug reactions , and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan
in the u s federal health care system \( including the va , the indian health service , and nih \) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority in some states such north carolina and new mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority in 2011 the board of pharmaceutical specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification the official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be board certified ambulatory care pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials bcacp
consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review \( i e cognitive services \) than on actual dispensing of drugs consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes , but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non institutional settings traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners , though in the united states many now work for several large pharmacy management companies \( primarily omnicare , kindred healthcare and pharmerica \) this trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients , primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and or provide consulting services
since about the year 2000 , a growing number of internet pharmacies have been established worldwide many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies , and in fact , many of them are actually operated by brick and mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door the primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take internet pharmacies \( also known as online pharmacies \) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound
while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription , some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the inconvenience of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe however , this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous , especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications , risk benefit ratios , and an individual 's overall suitability for use of a medication there also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products
of particular concern with internet pharmacies is the ease with which people , youth in particular , can obtain controlled substances \( e g , vicodin , generically known as hydrocodone \) via the internet without a prescription issued by a doctor practitioner who has an established doctor patient relationship there are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription , brokered by an internet server , for a controlled substance to a patient s he has never met citation needed in the united states , in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid , it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor patient relationship the filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid often , individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient doctor relationship
in the united states , there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from canada and other countries , in order to reduce consumer costs while in most cases importation of prescription medications violates food and drug administration \( fda \) regulations and federal laws , enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers , rather than consumers there is no known case of any u s citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription , who has ever been charged by authorities
pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy , however , they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies as a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development , deployment and optimization
specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable , oral , infused , or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer , hepatitis , and rheumatoid arthritis unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled , specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored , administered , carefully monitored , and clinically managed in addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs it is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly fda approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs
in most jurisdictions \( such as the united states \) , pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them kickback payments however , the american medical association \( ama \) code of ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere 7 to 10 percent of american physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own
in some rural areas in the united kingdom , there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription only medicines to their patients from within their practices the law requires that the gp practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified , minimum distance \( currently 1 6 kilometres \) between a patient 's home and the nearest retail pharmacy this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city
the reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and or the avoidance of absolute powers otherwise , the physician has a financial self interest in diagnosing as many conditions as possible , and in exaggerating their seriousness , because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient such self interest directly conflicts with the patient 's interest in obtaining cost effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side effects this system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the u s and many other governments citation needed
in the coming decades , pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system rather than simply dispensing medication , pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills in particular , medication therapy management \( mtm \) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients such services include the thorough analysis of all medication \( prescription , non prescription , and herbals \) currently being taken by an individual the result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system
this shift has already commenced in some countries for instance , pharmacists in australia receive remuneration from the australian government for conducting comprehensive home medicines reviews in canada , pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights \( as in alberta and british columbia \) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews \( medschecks in ontario \) in the united kingdom , pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education they are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews in scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for scottish registered patients of their regular medications , for the majority of drugs , except for controlled drugs , when the patient is unable to see their doctor , as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable in the united states , pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy moreover , the doctor of pharmacy \( pharm d \) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation in addition , consultant pharmacists , who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients , under the banner of senior care pharmacy
the two symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy in english speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the \( recipere \) character , which is often written as rx in typed text the show globe was also used until the early 20th century pharmacy organizations often use other symbols , such as the bowl of hygieia which is often used in the netherlands , conical measures , and caduceuses in their logos other symbols are common in different countries the green greek cross in france , argentina , the united kingdom , belgium , ireland , italy , spain , and india , the increasingly rare gaper in the netherlands , and a red stylized letter a in germany and austria \( from apotheke , the german word for pharmacy , from the same greek root as the english word 'apothecary' \)
the immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease to function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue in many species , the immune system can be classified into subsystems , such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system , or humoral immunity versus cell mediated immunity in humans , the blood brain barrier , blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain
pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates these mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system jawed vertebrates , including humans , have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms , including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently adaptive \( or acquired \) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen this process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination
disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal , resulting in recurring and life threatening infections in humans , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency , acquired conditions such as hiv aids , or the use of immunosuppressive medication in contrast , autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms common autoimmune diseases include hashimoto 's thyroiditis , rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 , and systemic lupus erythematosus immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system
immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system it originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of athens in 430 bc thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time in the 18th century , pierre louis moreau de maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom this and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by louis pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease pasteur 's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease , such as the miasma theory it was not until robert koch 's 1891 proofs , for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905 , that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 , with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by walter reed
the immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity in simple terms , physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism if a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non specific response innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals if pathogens successfully evade the innate response , vertebrates possess a second layer of protection , the adaptive immune system , which is activated by the innate response here , the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered
both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non self molecules in immunology , self molecules are those components of an organism 's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system conversely , non self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules one class of non self molecules are called antigens \( short for antibody generators \) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response
microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system the innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors , which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms , or when damaged , injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals , many of which \( but not all \) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens innate immune defenses are non specific , meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way this system does not confer long lasting immunity against a pathogen the innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms
several barriers protect organisms from infection , including mechanical , chemical , and biological barriers the waxy cuticle of many leaves , the exoskeleton of insects , the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs , and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection however , as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments , other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs , intestines , and the genitourinary tract in the lungs , coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens , while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms
chemical barriers also protect against infection the skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the defensins enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase a2 in saliva , tears , and breast milk are also antibacterials vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens in the stomach , gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens
within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and , in some cases , by changing the conditions in their environment , such as ph or available iron this reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness however , since most antibiotics non specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi , oral antibiotics can lead to an overgrowth of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis \( a yeast infection \) there is good evidence that re introduction of probiotic flora , such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt , helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis , inflammatory bowel diseases , urinary tract infection and post surgical infections
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection the symptoms of inflammation are redness , swelling , heat , and pain , which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines , which are released by injured or infected cells eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation , and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells \( leukocytes \) common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells chemokines that promote chemotaxis and interferons that have anti viral effects , such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released these cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens
phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf , or eat , pathogens or particles phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens , but can be called to specific locations by cytokines once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte , it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome , which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome the pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients , but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense , as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals
neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 to 60 of the total circulating leukocytes during the acute phase of inflammation , particularly as a result of bacterial infection , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1 macrophages also act as scavengers , ridding the body of worn out cells and other debris , and as antigen presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system
leukocytes \( white blood cells \) act like independent , single celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system the innate leukocytes include the phagocytes \( macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells \) , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils , and natural killer cells these cells identify and eliminate pathogens , either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system
dendritic cells \( dc \) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment therefore , they are located mainly in the skin , nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines they are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites , as both have many spine like projections , but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , as they present antigens to t cells , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system
natural killer cells , or nk cells , are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes rather , nk cells destroy compromised host cells , such as tumor cells or virus infected cells , recognizing such cells by a condition known as missing self this term describes cells with low levels of a cell surface marker called mhc i \( major histocompatibility complex \) a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells they were named natural killer because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing self for many years it was unclear how nk cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells it is now known that the mhc makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the nk cells become activated through recognition of missing self normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by nk cells because they express intact self mhc antigens those mhc antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors \( kir \) which essentially put the brakes on nk cells
the adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory , where each pathogen is remembered by a signature antigen the adaptive immune response is antigen specific and requires the recognition of specific non self antigens during a process called antigen presentation antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen infected cells the ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by memory cells should a pathogen infect the body more than once , these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it
both b cells and t cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets t cells recognize a non self target , such as a pathogen , only after antigens \( small fragments of the pathogen \) have been processed and presented in combination with a self receptor called a major histocompatibility complex \( mhc \) molecule there are two major subtypes of t cells the killer t cell and the helper t cell in addition there are regulatory t cells which have a role in modulating immune response killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules , while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules these two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of t cell a third , minor subtype are the t cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to mhc receptors
killer t cells are a sub group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses \( and other pathogens \) , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional as with b cells , each type of t cell recognizes a different antigen killer t cells are activated when their t cell receptor \( tcr \) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell recognition of this mhc antigen complex is aided by a co receptor on the t cell , called cd8 the t cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the mhc i receptors bear this antigen when an activated t cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter the entry of another toxin called granulysin \( a protease \) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis t cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses t cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong mhc antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by helper t cells \( see below \)
helper t cells express t cell receptors \( tcr \) that recognize antigen bound to class ii mhc molecules the mhc antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's cd4 co receptor , which recruits molecules inside the t cell \( e g , lck \) that are responsible for the t cell 's activation helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors \( around 200 300 \) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc antigen molecule helper t cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen presenting cell the activation of a resting helper t cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types cytokine signals produced by helper t cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer t cells in addition , helper t cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the t cell 's surface , such as cd40 ligand \( also called cd154 \) , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody producing b cells
gamma delta t cells \( t cells \) possess an alternative t cell receptor \( tcr \) as opposed to cd4 and cd8 \( \) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells the conditions that produce responses from t cells are not fully understood like other 'unconventional' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs , such as cd1d restricted natural killer t cells , t cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity on one hand , t cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange tcr genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype on the other hand , the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system , as restricted tcr or nk receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors for example , large numbers of human v 9 v 2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted v 1 t cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells
a b cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen this antigen antibody complex is taken up by the b cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides the b cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface mhc class ii molecules this combination of mhc and antigen attracts a matching helper t cell , which releases lymphokines and activates the b cell as the activated b cell then begins to divide , its offspring \( plasma cells \) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen these antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph , bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly , by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells
when b cells and t cells are activated and begin to replicate , some of their offspring become long lived memory cells throughout the lifetime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again this is adaptive because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short term memory or active long term memory
newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother during pregnancy , a particular type of antibody , called igg , is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta , so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth , with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies this is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies it only borrows them this passive immunity is usually short term , lasting from a few days up to several months in medicine , protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody rich serum
hormones can act as immunomodulators , altering the sensitivity of the immune system for example , female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially , and their onset often coincides with puberty by contrast , male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well , most notably prolactin , growth hormone and vitamin d
when suffering from sleep deprivation , active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production , and a lower immune response , than would be noted in a well rested individual additionally , proteins such as nfil3 , which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both t cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms , can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation , shift work , etc as a result , these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease , chronic pain , and asthma
it is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals conversely , some hormones are regulated by the immune system , notably thyroid hormone activity the age related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin d levels in the elderly as people age , two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin d levels first , they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels this means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via uvb radiation second , as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin d
the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens this allows killer t cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal nk cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal this is a common phenomenon with tumors sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system
unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as pathogen associated molecular patterns or pamps when a part of a plant becomes infected , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant systemic acquired resistance \( sar \) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication
overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , particularly the autoimmune disorders here , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non self , and attacks part of the body under normal circumstances , many t cells and antibodies react with self peptides one of the functions of specialized cells \( located in the thymus and bone marrow \) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self antigens , preventing autoimmunity
immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence in developed countries , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function however , malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell mediated immunity , complement activity , phagocyte function , iga antibody concentrations , and cytokine production additionally , the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection
long term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of b and t cells active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination the principle behind vaccination \( also called immunization \) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism this deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system , as well as its inducibility with infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population , vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed
the success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses therefore , pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host , while evading detection or destruction by the immune system bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type ii secretion system alternatively , using a type iii secretion system , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host these proteins are often used to shut down host defenses
in the mid 1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory \( cst \) of immunity on the basis of cst , burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self nonself distinction self constituents \( constituents of the body \) do not trigger destructive immune responses , while nonself entities \( pathogens , an allograft \) trigger a destructive immune response the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex two signal activation of t cells the self nonself theory of immunity and the self nonself vocabulary have been criticized , but remain very influential
anti inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis , and their use must be tightly controlled lower doses of anti inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated t cells however , the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected , which causes toxic side effects immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent t cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways
in contrast , during wake periods differentiated effector cells , such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and ctls \( cytotoxic t lymphocytes \) , peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens as well during awake active times , anti inflammatory molecules , such as cortisol and catecholamines , peak there are two theories as to why the pro inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time first , inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times second , inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time
when a t cell encounters a foreign pathogen , it extends a vitamin d receptor this is essentially a signaling device that allows the t cell to bind to the active form of vitamin d , the steroid hormone calcitriol t cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin d not only does the t cell extend a vitamin d receptor , in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin d , calcitriol , but the t cell expresses the gene cyp27b1 , which is the gene responsible for converting the pre hormone version of vitamin d , calcidiol into the steroid hormone version , calcitriol only after binding to calcitriol can t cells perform their intended function other immune system cells that are known to express cyp27b1 and thus activate vitamin d calcidiol , are dendritic cells , keratinocytes and macrophages
pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants , and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity the complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life ribonucleases and the rna interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes , and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses
evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system \( e g , immunoglobulins and t cell receptors \) exist only in jawed vertebrates however , a distinct lymphocyte derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates , such as the lamprey and hagfish these animals possess a large array of molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors \( vlrs \) that , like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates , are produced from only a small number \( one or two \) of genes these molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies , and with the same degree of specificity
it is likely that a multicomponent , adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates , as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody based humoral response many species , however , utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens , called bacteriophages prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity , through a system that uses crispr sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past , which allows them to block virus replication through a form of rna interference offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes , but studies of their roles in defense are few
immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between cellular and humoral theories of immunity according to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by elie metchnikoff , it was cells more precisely , phagocytes that were responsible for immune responses in contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by robert koch and emil von behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components \( molecules \) found in the organism s humors rather than its cells
clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers tumor cells often have a reduced number of mhc class i molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer t cells some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response for example by secreting the cytokine tgf , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes in addition , immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens , so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells
hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues they are divided into four classes \( type i iv \) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction type i hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death type i hypersensitivity is mediated by ige , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross linked by antigen type ii hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction this is also called antibody dependent \( or cytotoxic \) hypersensitivity , and is mediated by igg and igm antibodies immune complexes \( aggregations of antigens , complement proteins , and igg and igm antibodies \) deposited in various tissues trigger type iii hypersensitivity reactions type iv hypersensitivity \( also known as cell mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity \) usually takes between two and three days to develop type iv reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases , but may also involve contact dermatitis \( poison ivy \) these reactions are mediated by t cells , monocytes , and macrophages
an evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host \( also called intracellular pathogenesis \) here , a pathogen spends most of its life cycle inside host cells , where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells , antibodies and complement some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria \( plasmodium falciparum \) and leishmaniasis \( leishmania spp \) other bacteria , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis , live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host 's immune response some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system such biofilms are present in many successful infections , e g , the chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective examples include streptococcus \( protein g \) , staphylococcus aureus \( protein a \) , and peptostreptococcus magnus \( protein l \)
the mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated the simplest approach is to rapidly change non essential epitopes \( amino acids and or sugars \) on the surface of the pathogen , while keeping essential epitopes concealed this is called antigenic variation an example is hiv , which mutates rapidly , so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing these frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus the parasite trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy , constantly switching one type of surface protein for another , allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system in hiv , the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell such self cloaked viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as non self structures
another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors this is called immune surveillance the transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells to the immune system , these antigens appear foreign , and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells the antigens expressed by tumors have several sources some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus , which causes cervical cancer , while others are the organism 's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells one example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that , when expressed at high levels , transforms certain skin cells \( e g melanocytes \) into tumors called melanomas a third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival , that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes
larger drugs \( 500 da \) can provoke a neutralizing immune response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger doses this limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins \( which are typically larger than 6000 da \) in some cases , the drug itself is not immunogenic , but may be co administered with an immunogenic compound , as is sometimes the case for taxol computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins , which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies , assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles , and validation of proposed peptide based drug treatments early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids however , more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes , usually on well studied virus proteins , as a training set a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by b cells the emerging field of bioinformatics based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins \( proteomics \) involved in the immune response
in addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation , sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity first , during the early slow wave sleep stage , a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol , epinephrine , and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin these signals induce a pro inflammatory state through the production of the pro inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 , interleukin 12 , tnf alpha and ifn gamma these cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation , proliferation , and differentiation it is during this time that undifferentiated , or less differentiated , like na ve and central memory t cells , peak \( i e during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response \) in addition to these effects , the milieu of hormones produced at this time \( leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin \) support the interactions between apcs and t cells , a shift of the th1 th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports th1 , an increase in overall th cell proliferation , and na ve t cell migration to lymph nodes this milieu is also thought to support the formation of long lasting immune memory through the initiation of th1 immune responses
in humans , this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes this recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response the speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules , which are also proteases after complement proteins initially bind to the microbe , they activate their protease activity , which in turn activates other complement proteases , and so on this produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback the cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells , increase vascular permeability , and opsonize \( coat \) the surface of a pathogen , marking it for destruction this deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane
one of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by egyptians against the british occupation in the 1919 revolution civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws it has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in india \( gandhi 's campaigns for independence from the british empire \) , in czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution and in east germany to oust their communist governments , in south africa in the fight against apartheid , in the american civil rights movement , in the singing revolution to bring independence to the baltic countries from the soviet union , recently with the 2003 rose revolution in georgia and the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine , among other various movements worldwide
one of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in sophocles' play antigone , in which antigone , one of the daughters of former king of thebes , oedipus , defies creon , the current king of thebes , who is trying to stop her from giving her brother polynices a proper burial she gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law she is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with \( and eventually carries out \) , but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this
following the peterloo massacre of 1819 , poet percy shelley wrote the political poem the mask of anarchy later that year , that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action it is perhaps the first modern vague statement of the principle of nonviolent protest a version was taken up by the author henry david thoreau in his essay civil disobedience , and later by gandhi in his doctrine of satyagraha gandhi 's satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by shelley 's nonviolence in protest and political action in particular , it is known that gandhi would often quote shelley 's masque of anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free india
it has been argued that the term civil disobedience has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times , become utterly debased marshall cohen notes , it has been used to describe everything from bringing a test case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official indeed , for vice president agnew it has become a code word describing the activities of muggers , arsonists , draft evaders , campaign hecklers , campus militants , anti war demonstrators , juvenile delinquents and political assassins
legrande writes that the formulation of a single all encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult , if not impossible in reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject , the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties like alice in wonderland , he often finds that specific terminology has no more \( or no less \) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have he encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration , nonviolent civil disobedience , and violent civil disobedience
civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen 's relation to the state and its laws , as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies , especially two equally sovereign branches of government , conflict for instance , if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country 's highest court , it would not be civil disobedience , since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen
however , this definition is disputed by thoreau 's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs the collective the individual is the final judge of right and wrong more than this , since only individuals act , only individuals can act unjustly when the government knocks on the door , it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood before thoreau s imprisonment , when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay , thoreau had advised , resign if a man chose to be an agent of injustice , then thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice but if government is the voice of the people , as it is often called , shouldn t that voice be heeded \? thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians even a good form of government is liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it moreover , even if a government did express the voice of the people , this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said the majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right what , then , is the proper relationship between the individual and the government \?
some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non governmental agencies such as trade unions , banks , and private universities can be justified if it reflects a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken the same principle , she argues , applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments
it is usually recognized that lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience but stephen eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality , we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking if a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights , he might , for instance , find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience this assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations the fully informed jury association 's publication a primer for prospective jurors notes , think of the dilemma faced by german citizens when hitler 's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a jew in their house by this definition , civil disobedience could be traced back to the book of exodus , where shiphrah and puah refused a direct order of pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it \( exodus 1 15 19 \)
there have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non violent black 's law dictionary includes non violence in its definition of civil disobedience christian bay 's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires carefully chosen and legitimate means , but holds that they do not have to be non violent it has been argued that , while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects , rebellion is much more destructive therefore , the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience , and if one cannot justify civil rebellion , then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society 's tolerance of civil disobedience
non revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged wrong by an individual conscience , or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective , to cause their repeal , or to exert pressure to get one 's political wishes on some other issue revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government \( or to change cultural traditions , social customs , religious beliefs , etc revolution does n't have to be political , i e cultural revolution , it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric \) gandhi 's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience it has been claimed that the hungarians under ferenc de k directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the austrian government thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing peaceable revolution howard zinn , harvey wheeler , and others have identified the right espoused in the declaration of independence to alter or abolish an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience
the earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the roman empire citation needed unarmed jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the temple in jerusalem citation needed original research \? in modern times , some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met , such as favorable bail conditions , or the release of all the activists this is a form of jail solidarity page needed there have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience , such as that committed by thoreau , but these sometimes go unnoticed thoreau , at the time of his arrest , was not yet a well known author , and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days , weeks and months after it happened the tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office , and thoreau 's essay was not published until after the end of the mexican war
civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts bedau writes , there is a whole class of acts , undertaken in the name of civil disobedience , which , even if they were widely practiced , would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance \( e g trespassing at a nuclear missile installation \) such acts are often just a harassment and , at least to the bystander , somewhat inane the remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity bedau also notes , though , that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose some civil disobedients , such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and voice in the wilderness , which brought medicine to iraq without the permission of the u s government , directly achieve a desired social goal \( such as the provision of medication to the sick \) while openly breaking the law julia butterfly hill lived in luna , a 180 foot \( 55 m \) tall , 600 year old california redwood tree for 738 days , successfully preventing it from being cut down
in cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech , civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech an example would be wbai 's broadcasting the track filthy words from a george carlin comedy album , which eventually led to the 1978 supreme court case of fcc v pacifica foundation threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies for example , joseph haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the lebanon , new hampshire city councilors stating , wise up or die
some forms of civil disobedience , such as illegal boycotts , refusals to pay taxes , draft dodging , distributed denial of service attacks , and sit ins , make it more difficult for a system to function in this way , they might be considered coercive brownlee notes that although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue , nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table the plowshares organization temporarily closed gcsb waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes
many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases for example , the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property , and whether or not to talk to police officers it is generally agreed within the legal community , and is often believed within the activist community , that a suspect 's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose , and may be harmful however , some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions , sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications , or due to a fear of seeming rude also , some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers thoreau wrote , my civil neighbor , the tax gatherer , is the very man i have to deal with for it is , after all , with men and not with parchment that i quarrel and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government how shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government , or as a man , until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me , his neighbor , for whom he has respect , as a neighbor and well disposed man , or as a maniac and disturber of the peace , and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action
some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established , or else suffer the penalties set out in the law other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , or do n't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted and still other civil disobedients , being anarchists , do n't believe in the legitimacy of any government , and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others
an important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty there is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law it has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience act up 's civil disobedience training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating , yes , i committed the act of which you accuse me i do n't deny it in fact , i am proud of it i feel i did the right thing by violating this particular law i am guilty as charged , but that pleading not guilty sends a message of , guilt implies wrong doing i feel i have done no wrong i may have violated some specific laws , but i am guilty of doing no wrong i therefore plead not guilty a plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two one defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , i plead for the beauty that surrounds us this is known as a creative plea , and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty
when the committee for non violent action sponsored a protest in august 1957 , at the camp mercury nuclear test site near las vegas , nevada , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest at a pre arranged announced time , one at a time they stepped across the line and were immediately arrested they were put on a bus and taken to the nye county seat of tonopah , nevada , and arraigned for trial before the local justice of the peace , that afternoon a well known civil rights attorney , francis heisler , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , advising them to plead nolo contendere , as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not guilty the arrested persons were found guilty , nevertheless , and given suspended sentences , conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds citation needed
howard zinn writes , there may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice but that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience the key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it to accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest in particular , the neo conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated
sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients , as in the case of the camden 28 , in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time in some mass arrest situations , the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone but some activists have opted to enter a blind plea , pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place mohandas gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court , i am here to submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen
some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech , or a speech explaining their actions , in allocution in u s v burgos andujar , a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on u s navy property argued to the court in allocution that the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the navy as a result , the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days this action was upheld because , according to the u s court of appeals for the first circuit , her statement suggested a lack of remorse , an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions , and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials
steven barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience a technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage during the vietnam war era , the chicago eight used a political defense , while benjamin spock used a technical defense in countries such as the united states whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes , some civil disobedients seek jury nullification over the years , this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as sparf v united states , which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative , and united states v dougherty , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification
one theory is that , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit therefore , conscientious lawbreakers must be punished michael bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law , and then wins his case , then that act did not constitute civil disobedience it has also been argued that breaking the law for self gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient
courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not , itself , the object of protest , whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law during the vietnam war , courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the vietnam war the courts ruled it was a political question the necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts , and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom however , court cases such as u s v schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense likewise , when carter wentworth was charged for his role in the clamshell alliance 's 1977 illegal occupation of the seabrook station nuclear power plant , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , and he was found guilty fully informed jury association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to according to fija , many of them have escaped prosecution because prosecutors have reasoned \( correctly \) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters , the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter 's own jury as evidence
along with giving the offender his just deserts , achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment brownlee argues , bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law leonard hubert hoffmann writes , in deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good this means that the objector has no right not to be punished it is a matter for the state \( including the judges \) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not
construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries construction starts with planning , citation needed design , and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use
large scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines an architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it for the successful execution of a project , effective planning is essential those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements , the environmental impact of the job , the successful scheduling , budgeting , construction site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding , etc the largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects
in general , there are three sectors of construction buildings , infrastructure and industrial building construction is usually further divided into residential and non residential \( commercial institutional \) infrastructure is often called heavy highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering it includes large public works , dams , bridges , highways , water wastewater and utility distribution industrial includes refineries , process chemical , power generation , mills and manufacturing plants there are other ways to break the industry into sectors or markets
engineering news record \( enr \) is a trade magazine for the construction industry each year , enr compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies they publish a list of the largest companies in the united states \( top 40 \) and also a list the largest global firms \( top 250 , by amount of work they are doing outside their home country \) in 2014 , enr compiled the data in nine market segments it was divided as transportation , petroleum , buildings , power , industrial , water , manufacturing , sewer waste , telecom , hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects in their reporting on the top 400 , they used data on transportation , sewer , hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors
the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction to recognize the differences of companies in this sector , it is divided into three subsectors building construction , heavy and civil engineering construction , and specialty trade contractors there are also categories for construction service firms \( e g , engineering , architecture \) and construction managers \( firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project \)
building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings the majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom often , the owner of the property acts as laborer , paymaster , and design team for the entire project although building construction projects typically include various common elements , such as design , financial , estimating and legal considerations , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , such as structural collapse , cost overruns , and or litigation for this reason , those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome
residential construction practices , technologies , and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used \( e g brick versus stone , versus timber \) cost of construction on a per square meter \( or per square foot \) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions , local regulations , economies of scale \( custom designed homes are often more expensive to build \) and the availability of skilled tradespeople as residential construction \( as well as all other types of construction \) can generate a lot of waste , careful planning again is needed here
new techniques of building construction are being researched , made possible by advances in 3d printing technology in a form of additive building construction , similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts , building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours , with built in plumbing and electrical facilities , in one continuous build , using large 3d printers working versions of 3d printing building technology are already printing 2 metres \( 6 ft 7 in \) of building material per hour as of january 2013 update , with the next generation printers capable of 3 5 metres \( 11 ft \) per hour , sufficient to complete a building in a week dutch architect janjaap ruijssenaars 's performative architecture 3d printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014
in the modern industrialized world , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts the design usually consists of drawings and specifications , usually prepared by a design team including architect , civil engineers , mechanical engineers , electrical engineers , structural engineers , fire protection engineers , planning consultants , architectural consultants , and archaeological consultants the design team is most commonly employed by \( i e in contract with \) the property owner under this system , once the design is completed by the design team , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , either based directly on the design , or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor following evaluation of bids , the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder
the modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties , especially among large firms in the past , architects , interior designers , engineers , developers , construction managers , and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies , even in the larger firms presently , a firm that is nominally an architecture or construction management firm may have experts from all related fields as employees , or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill thus , each such firm may offer itself as one stop shopping for a construction project , from beginning to end this is designated as a design build contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction , while adhering to the performance specifications
several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , including design build , partnering and construction management in general , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , interior designers , engineers and constructors throughout design and construction in response , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design build process
construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials , and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time , can arise even when the overall total is enough fraud is a problem in many fields , but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project
mortgage bankers , accountants , and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects since the owner 's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs , which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid
the project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations , or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad bridge collapses or explosions other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things that are a matter of custom or expectation , such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built , either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable \( the bridge design will not cause a collapse \) , or that the custom is no longer needed \( acceptance of live work spaces has grown in the community \)
a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , each of which all parties must carefully consider a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties , but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible the time element in construction means that a delay costs money , and in cases of bottlenecks , the delay can be extremely expensive thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse
there is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project new forms include partnering such as public private partnering \( ppps \) aka private finance initiatives \( pfis \) and alliances such as pure or project alliances and impure or strategic alliances the focus on co operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry
this is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized in this arrangement , the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator his or her role is to design the works , prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings , administer the contract , tender the works , and manage the works from inception to completion there are direct contractual links between the architect 's client and the main contractor any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor the procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy
the owner produces a list of requirements for a project , giving an overall view of the project 's goals several d b contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals the owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor often , it is not just one contractor , but a consortium of several contractors working together once these have been hired , they begin building the first phase of the project as they build phase 1 , they design phase 2 this is in contrast to a design bid build contract , where the project is completely designed by the owner , then bid on , then completed
before the foundation can be dug , contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked , either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services this lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , water , sewage , phone , and cable facilities , which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations during the construction of a building , the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed , an occupancy permit may be issued

in india , private schools are called independent schools , but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government , it can be an aided or an unaided school so , in a strict sense , a private school is an unaided independent school for the purpose of this definition , only receipt of financial aid is considered , not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate it is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since education appears in the concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution the practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector among other things , this has also resulted in 30 different examination boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates prominent examination boards that are present in multiple states are the cbse and the cisce , nenbse

in the early years the college trained many puritan ministers citation needed \( a 1643 publication said the school 's purpose was to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity , dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust \) it offered a classic curriculum on the english university model many leaders in the colony had attended the university of cambridge but conformed puritanism it was never affiliated with any particular denomination , but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in congregational and unitarian churches
throughout the 18th century , enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among congregationalist ministers , putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist , calvinist parties 1 4 when the hollis professor of divinity david tappan died in 1803 and the president of harvard joseph willard died a year later , in 1804 , a struggle broke out over their replacements henry ware was elected to the chair in 1805 , and the liberal samuel webber was appointed to the presidency of harvard two years later , which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at harvard to the dominance of liberal , arminian ideas \( defined by traditionalists as unitarian ideas \) 4 5 24
in 1846 , the natural history lectures of louis agassiz were acclaimed both in new york and on the campus at harvard college agassiz 's approach was distinctly idealist and posited americans' participation in the divine nature and the possibility of understanding intellectual existences agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the divine plan in all phenomena when it came to explaining life forms , agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence this dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of common sense realism derived from scottish philosophers thomas reid and dugald stewart , whose works were part of the harvard curriculum at the time the popularity of agassiz 's efforts to soar with plato probably also derived from other writings to which harvard students were exposed , including platonic treatises by ralph cudworth , john norrisand , in a romantic vein , samuel coleridge the library records at harvard reveal that the writings of plato and his early modern and romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the official philosophy of the more empirical and more deistic scottish school
charles w eliot , president 1869 1909 , eliminated the favored position of christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self direction while eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of american higher education , he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education , but by transcendentalist unitarian convictions derived from william ellery channing and ralph waldo emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature , the right and ability of each person to perceive truth , and the indwelling god in each person
james bryant conant \( president , 1933 1953 \) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions he saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy , so conant devised programs to identify , recruit , and support talented youth in 1943 , he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be , at the secondary as well as the college level the resulting report , published in 1945 , was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of american education in the 20th century

the harvard crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the ncaa division i ivy league harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with yale university culminating in the game , although the harvard yale regatta predates the football game this rivalry , though , is put aside every two years when the harvard and yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined oxford university and cambridge university team , a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world
harvard 's athletic rivalry with yale is intense in every sport in which they meet , coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting , which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply the game while harvard 's football team is no longer one of the country 's best as it often was a century ago during football 's early days \( it won the rose bowl in 1920 \) , both it and yale have influenced the way the game is played in 1903 , harvard stadium introduced a new era into football with the first ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country the stadium 's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport , walter camp \( former captain of the yale football team \) , suggested widening the field to open up the game but the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface so , other steps had to be taken camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season these included legalizing the forward pass , perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport 's history

french huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st johns river in 1562 calling it the river of may because he discovered it in may ribault erected a stone column near present day jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for france in 1564 , ren goulaine de laudonni re established the first european settlement , fort caroline , on the st johns near the main village of the saturiwa philip ii of spain ordered pedro men ndez de avil s to protect the interest of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline on september 20 , 1565 , a spanish force from the nearby spanish settlement of st augustine attacked fort caroline , and killed nearly all the french soldiers defending it the spanish renamed the fort san mateo , and following the ejection of the french , st augustine 's position as the most important settlement in florida was solidified the location of fort caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the st johns river in 1964
spain ceded florida to the british in 1763 after the french and indian war , and the british soon constructed the king 's road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point , which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford or cowford these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane , indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber as a result , the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the spanish britain ceded control of the territory back to spain in 1783 , after its defeat in the american revolutionary war , and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821 , american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town , laying out the streets and plats they soon named the town jacksonville , after andrew jackson led by isaiah d hart , residents wrote a charter for a town government , which was approved by the florida legislative council on february 9 , 1832
during the american civil war , jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from florida to aid the confederate cause the city was blockaded by union forces , who gained control of the nearby fort clinch though no battles were fought in jacksonville proper , the city changed hands several times between union and confederate forces the skirmish of the brick church in 1862 just outside jacksonville proper resulted in the first confederate victory in florida in february 1864 union forces left jacksonville and confronted a confederate army at the battle of olustee resulting in a confederate victory union forces then retreated to jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war in march 1864 a confederate cavalry confronted a union expedition resulting in the battle of cedar creek warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war

jacksonville , like most large cities in the united states , suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after world war ii the construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs after world war ii , the government of the city of jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war mayor w haydon burns' jacksonville story resulted in the construction of a new city hall , civic auditorium , public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride however , the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class white flight left jacksonville with a much poorer population than before the city 's most populous ethnic group , non hispanic white , declined from 75 8 in 1970 to 55 1 by 2010
much of the city 's tax base dissipated , leading to problems with funding education , sanitation , and traffic control within the city limits in addition , residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services , such as sewage and building code enforcement in 1958 , a study recommended that the city of jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965
in the mid 1960s , corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city 's officials , who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network after a grand jury was convened to investigate , 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign jacksonville consolidation , led by j j daniel and claude yates , began to win more support during this period , from both inner city blacks , who wanted more involvement in government , and whites in the suburbs , who wanted more services and more control over the central city in 1964 all 15 of duval county 's public high schools lost their accreditation this added momentum to proposals for government reform lower taxes , increased economic development , unification of the community , better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government
when a consolidation referendum was held in 1967 , voters approved the plan on october 1 , 1968 , the governments merged to create the consolidated city of jacksonville fire , police , health welfare , recreation , public works , and housing urban development were all combined under the new government in honor of the occasion , then mayor hans tanzler posed with actress lee meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the bold new city of the south at florida 13 and julington creek the better jacksonville plan , promoted as a blueprint for jacksonville 's future and approved by jacksonville voters in 2000 , authorized a half penny sales tax this would generate most of the revenue required for the 2 25 billion package of major projects that included road infrastructure improvements , environmental preservation , targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities

like much of the south atlantic region of the united states , jacksonville has a humid subtropical climate \( k ppen cfa \) , with mild weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from may through september , while the driest months are from november through april due to jacksonville 's low latitude and coastal location , the city sees very little cold weather , and winters are typically mild and sunny summers can be hot and wet , and summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are common
mean monthly temperatures range from around 53 f in january to 82 f in july high temperatures average 64 to 92 f \( 18 to 33 c \) throughout the year high heat indices are common for the summer months in the area , with indices above 110 f \( 43 3 c \) possible the highest temperature recorded was 104 f \( 40 c \) on july 11 , 1879 and july 28 , 1872 it is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon these are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water , combined with extremely high humidity
jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities , although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane the city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871 however , jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the gulf of mexico to the atlantic ocean , or passing to the north or south in the atlantic and brushing past the area the strongest effect on jacksonville was from hurricane dora in 1964 , the only recorded storm to hit the first coast with sustained hurricane force winds the eye crossed st augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph \( 180 km h \) , making it a strong category 2 on the saffir simpson scale jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008 's tropical storm fay which crisscrossed the state , bringing parts of jacksonville under darkness for four days similarly , four years prior to this , jacksonville was inundated by hurricane frances and hurricane jeanne , which made landfall south of the area these tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to jacksonville hurricane floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to jacksonville beach during floyd , the jacksonville beach pier was severely damaged , and later demolished the rebuilt pier was later damaged by fay , but not destroyed tropical storm bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004 , spawning a minor tornado in the process on may 28 , 2012 , jacksonville was hit by tropical storm beryl , packing winds up to 70 miles per hour \( 113 km h \) which made landfall near jacksonville beach

a study by the world institute for development economics research at united nations university reports that the richest 1 of adults alone owned 40 of global assets in the year 2000 the three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined the combined wealth of the 10 million dollar millionaires grew to nearly 41 trillion in 2008 a january 2014 report by oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50 of the world 's population , or about 3 5 billion people according to a los angeles times analysis of the report , the wealthiest 1 owns 46 of the world 's wealth the 85 richest people , a small part of the wealthiest 1 , own about 0 7 of the human population 's wealth , which is the same as the bottom half of the population more recently , in january 2015 , oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016 an october 2014 study by credit suisse also claims that the top 1 now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession in october 2015 , credit suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed 759 , 900 a 2016 report by oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined oxfam 's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used by using net wealth \( adding up assets and subtracting debts \) , the oxfam report , for instance , finds that there are more poor people in the united states and western europe than in china \( due to a greater tendency to take on debts \) unreliable source \? unreliable source \? anthony shorrocks , the lead author of the credit suisse report which is one of the sources of oxfam 's data , considers the criticism about debt to be a silly argument and a non issue a diversion
according to politifact the top 400 richest americans have more wealth than half of all americans combined according to the new york times on july 22 , 2014 , the richest 1 percent in the united states now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent inherited wealth may help explain why many americans who have become rich may have had a substantial head start in september 2012 , according to the institute for policy studies , over 60 percent of the forbes richest 400 americans grew up in substantial privilege
neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor , capital and land within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers in this perspective , wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor \( worker , capitalist business owner , landlord \) thus , in a market economy , inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly paid professions and lower paid professions
in marxian analysis , capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs \( workers \) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits over the long term , this trend increases the organic composition of capital , meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs , increasing unemployment \( the reserve army of labour \) this process exerts a downward pressure on wages the substitution of capital equipment for labor \( mechanization and automation \) raises the productivity of each worker , resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class
in a purely capitalist mode of production \( i e where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers \) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market wages work in the same way as prices for any other good thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill and therefore , inequality is driven by this price under the law of supply and demand , the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker on the other hand , markets can also concentrate wealth , pass environmental costs on to society , and abuse workers and consumers markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor for a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest , it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers
a job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time \( high supply \) competing for a job that few require \( low demand \) will result in a low wage for that job this is because competition between workers drives down the wage an example of this would be jobs such as dish washing or customer service competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job a job where there are few able or willing workers \( low supply \) , but a large need for the positions \( high demand \) , will result in high wages for that job this is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills , rare abilities , or a high level of risk competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job , since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining , political influence , or corruption
on the other hand , higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level \( self employment \) however , most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity necessity based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter \( push motivations \) , whereas opportunity based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement oriented motivations \( pull \) such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products , services , or underserved market needs the economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth
another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system a progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases in a progressive tax system , the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society , either increasing it or decreasing it , provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime additionally , steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board the difference between the gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation
an important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education education , especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers , creates high wages for those with this education , however , increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality as a result , those who are unable to afford an education , or choose not to pursue optional education , generally receive much lower wages the justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment conversely , education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor
in 2014 , economists with the standard poor 's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the u s 's wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008 2009 recession and made it more prone to boom and bust cycles to partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth , s p recommended increasing access to education it estimated that if the average united states worker had completed just one more year of school , it would add an additional 105 billion in growth to the country 's economy over five years
during the mass high school education movement from 1910 1940 , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor high school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work in fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping stone to acquire college and advanced degrees this decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy lagerlof and galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap it is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries
john schmitt and ben zipperer \( 2006 \) of the cepr point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality in an analysis of the effects of intensive anglo american liberal policies in comparison to continental european liberalism , where unions have remained strong , they concluded the u s economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion , including high levels of income inequality , high relative and absolute poverty rates , poor and unequal educational outcomes , poor health outcomes , and high rates of crime and incarceration at the same time , the available evidence provides little support for the view that u s style labor market flexibility dramatically improves labor market outcomes despite popular prejudices to the contrary , the u s economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental european countries for which data is available
sociologist jake rosenfield of the university of washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the united states has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization , which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that did n't experience steep surges in inequality he points out that nations with high rates of unionization , particularly in scandinavia , have very low levels of inequality , and concludes the historical pattern is clear the cross national pattern is clear high inequality goes hand in hand with weak labor movements and vice versa
trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale when rich countries trade with poor countries , the low skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , while low skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages trade economist paul krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the united states he attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable however , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in america is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts empirical economists max roser and jesus crespo cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality they empirically confirm the predictions of the stolper samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes lawrence katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5 15 of rising income inequality robert lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries
in many countries , there is a gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap on average , women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work , and may be less willing to travel or relocate thomas sowell , in his book knowledge and decisions , claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy , but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference a u s census 's report stated that in us once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men the income gap in other countries ranges from 53 in botswana to 40 in bahrain
economist simon kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development according to kuznets , countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth as a country develops , it acquires more capital , which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality eventually , through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs , more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality
plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality , kuznets saw middle income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the kuznets curve kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross sectional data however , more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time as an example , income inequality did fall in the united states during its high school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter citation needed however , recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s this does not necessarily disprove kuznets' theory citation needed it may be possible that another kuznets' cycle is occurring , specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector citation needed this implies that it may be possible for multiple kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time
wealth concentration is a theoretical according to whom \? process by which , under certain conditions , newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already wealthy individuals or entities according to this theory , those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth , thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth over time , wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society thomas piketty in his book capital in the twenty first century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital \( r \) than economic growth \( g \) , and that larger fortunes generate higher returns pp 384 table 12 2 , u s university endowment size vs real annual rate of return
economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non market force known as rent seeking while the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation , greater productivity , etc , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , profits and large compensation a better explainer of growing inequality , according to stiglitz , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them this process , known to economists as rent seeking , brings income not from creation of wealth but from grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort
effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems , and lower rates of social goods , a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high end consumption , and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high end consumption for the top 21 industrialised countries , counting each person equally , life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries \( r 907 \) a similar relationship exists among us states \( r 620 \)
2013 economics nobel prize winner robert j shiller said that rising inequality in the united states and elsewhere is the most important problem increasing inequality harms economic growth high and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long run economic growth unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality associated effects support economic growth
british researchers richard g wilkinson and kate pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems \( obesity , mental illness , homicides , teenage births , incarceration , child conflict , drug use \) , and lower rates of social goods \( life expectancy by country , educational performance , trust among strangers , women 's status , social mobility , even numbers of patents issued \) in countries and states with higher inequality using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the us , they found social health problems lower in countries like japan and finland and states like utah and new hampshire with high levels of equality , than in countries \( us and uk \) and states \( mississippi and new york \) with large differences in household income
for most of human history higher material living standards full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel led to better health and longer lives this pattern of higher incomes longer lives still holds among poorer countries , where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases , but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world americans live no longer on average \( about 77 years in 2004 \) than greeks \( 78 years \) or new zealanders \( 78 \) , though the usa has a higher gdp per capita life expectancy in sweden \( 80 years \) and japan \( 82 \) where income was more equally distributed was longer
in recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality creating an index of health and social problems from nine factors , authors richard wilkinson and kate pickett found health and social problems more common in countries with bigger income inequalities , and more common among states in the us with larger income inequalities other studies have confirmed this relationship the unicef index of child well being in rich countries , studying 40 indicators in 22 countries , correlates with greater equality but not per capita income
crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions there have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries , as well as studying areas within countries daly et al 2001 found that among u s states and canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality they estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state fajnzylber et al \( 2002 \) found a similar relationship worldwide among comments in academic literature on the relationship between homicides and inequality are
following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number economic inequality is problematic a house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five , is an example of reduced distributive efficiency within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person \( the additional dollar \) decreases as a person becomes richer from this standpoint , for any given amount of wealth in society , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility some studies have found evidence for this theory , noting that in societies where inequality is lower , population wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher
conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption , rather than income should be the measure of inequality , and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the us will wilkinson of the libertarian cato institute states that the weight of the evidence shows that the run up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , and consumption is more important than income according to johnson , smeeding , and tory , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986 the debate is summarized in the hidden prosperity of the poor by journalist thomas b edsall other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality , and the cbo 's study found consumption data not adequately capturing consumption by high income households as it does their income , though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income
central banking economist raghuram rajan argues that systematic economic inequalities , within the united states and around the world , have created deep financial 'fault lines' that have made financial crises more likely to happen than in the past the financial crisis of 2007 08 being the most recent example to compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power , political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners particularly to buy homes and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low this has given the american economy a tendency to go from bubble to bubble fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation
according to international monetary fund economists , inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells \( not the rate of growth \) high levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity , but also the quality of a country 's institutions and high levels of education according to imf staff economists , if the income share of the top 20 percent \( the rich \) increases , then gdp growth actually declines over the medium term , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down in contrast , an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent \( the poor \) is associated with higher gdp growth the poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic , social , and political channels
according to economists david castells quintana and vicente royuela , increasing inequality harms economic growth high and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long run economic growth unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality associated effects support economic growth
economist joseph stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand economist branko milanovic , wrote in 2001 that , the view that income inequality harms growth or that improved equality can help sustain growth has become more widely held in recent years the main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development when physical capital mattered most , savings and investments were key then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital but now that human capital is scarcer than machines , widespread education has become the secret to growth
in 1993 , galor and zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development a 1996 study by perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth he showed that , in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach , inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation \( education , experience , and apprenticeship \) and higher level of fertility , and thereby lower levels of growth he found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation , which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment perotti concluded that , more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education both are reflected in higher rates of growth also , very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable , which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth
research by harvard economist robert barro , found that there is little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment according to work by barro in 1999 and 2000 , high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries a study of swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less , but no correlation after ten years studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time , and a negative impact on the duration of growth
studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the kuznets curve hypothesis , which states that with economic development , inequality first increases , then decreases economist thomas piketty challenges this notion , claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and violent economic and political shocks reduced inequality moreover , piketty argues that the magical kuznets curve hypothesis , with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run , cannot account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s
some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development according to a 1955 review , savings by the wealthy , if these increase with inequality , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand a 2013 report on nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth imf economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth developing countries with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years but longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution
while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction the growth elasticity of poverty can depend on the existing level of inequality for instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 per head and 40 of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki moon while economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty
in many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements reasons for extra legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building , in some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land other causes of extra legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency
a number of researchers \( david rodda , jacob vigdor , and janna matlack \) , argue that a shortage of affordable housing at least in the us is caused in part by income inequality david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased \( rhoda 1994 148 \) through gentrification of older neighbourhoods , for example , in east new york , rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units the ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace
firstly , certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone , such as the costs of housing , pensions , education and health care if the state does not provide these services , then for those on lower incomes , the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances secondly , aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt the result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability
the smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more environmental degradation this can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy , it increases their yearly carbon emissions this relation is expressed by the environmental kuznets curve \( ekc \) not in citation given it should be noted here however that in certain cases , with great economic inequality , there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste pollution is cleaned up better afterwards \( water treatment , filtering , \) also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier if there were fewer people however , this multiplier would be lower , and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well as such , the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well if \( as wwf argued \) , population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level \( 1 3 of current levels , so about 2 billion people \) , human inequality can be addressed corrected , while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage
socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners , creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock by contrast , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary in order to rectify this situation , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product
robert nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force \( usually in the form of taxation \) , and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force however , nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property , and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves john rawls argued in a theory of justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole , including the poorest members rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice some see rawls 's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy rawls 's theory of justice
the capabilities approach sometimes called the human development approach looks at income inequality and poverty as form of capability deprivation unlike neoliberalism , which defines well being as utility maximization , economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself its goal is to wid en people s choices and the level of their achieved well being through increasing functionings \( the things a person values doing \) , capabilities \( the freedom to enjoy functionings \) and agency \( the ability to pursue valued goals \)
when a person s capabilities are lowered , they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise an old , ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home there may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic , or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives as a result , income and economic inequality increases , and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid to prevent such inequality , this approach believes it s important to have political freedom , economic facilities , social opportunities , transparency guarantees , and protective security to ensure that people aren t denied their functionings , capabilities , and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income
doctor who is a british science fiction television programme produced by the bbc since 1963 the programme depicts the adventures of the doctor , a time lord a space and time travelling humanoid alien he explores the universe in his tardis , a sentient time travelling space ship its exterior appears as a blue british police box , which was a common sight in britain in 1963 when the series first aired accompanied by companions , the doctor combats a variety of foes , while working to save civilisations and help people in need
the show is a significant part of british popular culture , and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite the show has influenced generations of british television professionals , many of whom grew up watching the series the programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989 there was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot , in the form of a television film the programme was relaunched in 2005 by russell t davies , who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival , produced in house by bbc wales in cardiff the first series of the 21st century featured christopher eccleston in the title role and was produced by the bbc doctor who also spawned spin offs in multiple media , including torchwood \( 2006 2011 \) and the sarah jane adventures \( 2007 2011 \) , both created by russell t davies k 9 \( 2009 2010 \) and a single pilot episode of k 9 and company \( 1981 \) there also have been many spoofs and cultural references to the character in other media
twelve actors have headlined the series as the doctor the transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show , as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings , under the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation the show 's premise is that this is a life process of time lords through which the character of the doctor takes on a new body and , to some extent , new personality , which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species each actor 's portrayal differs , but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline the time travelling nature of the plot means that , on occasion , different doctors have met each other peter capaldi took on the role after matt smith 's exit in the 2013 christmas special the time of the doctor
doctor who follows the adventures of the primary character , a rogue time lord from the planet gallifrey , who simply goes by the name the doctor he fled from gallifrey in a stolen mark i type 40 tardis time and relative dimension in space time machine which allows him to travel across time and space the tardis has a chameleon circuit which normally allows the machine to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise however , the doctor 's tardis remains fixed as a blue british police box due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit
the doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures his companions are usually humans , as he has found a fascination with planet earth he often finds events that pique his curiosity as he tries to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history , using only his ingenuity and minimal resources , such as his versatile sonic screwdriver as a time lord , the doctor has the ability to regenerate when his body is mortally damaged , taking on a new appearance and personality the doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during his travels , including the daleks , the cybermen , and the master , another renegade time lord
doctor who first appeared on bbc tv at 17 16 20 gmt , eighty seconds after the scheduled programme time , 5 15 pm , on saturday , 23 november 1963 it was to be a regular weekly programme , each episode 25 minutes of transmission length discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year the head of drama , canadian sydney newman , was mainly responsible for developing the programme , with the first format document for the series being written by newman along with the head of the script department \( later head of serials \) donald wilson and staff writer c e webber writer anthony coburn , story editor david whitaker and initial producer verity lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series note 1 the programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience , as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history on 31 july 1963 whitaker commissioned terry nation to write a story under the title the mutants as originally written , the daleks and thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but nation later dropped the aliens and made the daleks the aggressors when the script was presented to newman and wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any bug eyed monsters the first serial had been completed and the bbc believed it was crucial that the next one be a success , but the mutants was the only script ready to go , so the show had little choice but to use it according to producer verity lambert we did n't have a lot of choice we only had the dalek serial to go we had a bit of a crisis of confidence because donald wilson was so adamant that we should n't make it had we had anything else ready we would have made that nation 's script became the second doctor who serial the daleks \( a k a the mutants \) the serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters , and was responsible for the bbc 's first merchandising boom
the bbc drama department 's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons , broadcast on bbc 1 falling viewing numbers , a decline in the public perception of the show and a less prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by jonathan powell , controller of bbc 1 although \( as series co star sophie aldred reported in the documentary doctor who more than 30 years in the tardis \) it was effectively , if not formally , cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990 , the bbc repeatedly affirmed that the series would return
while in house production had ceased , the bbc hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show philip segal , a british expatriate who worked for columbia pictures' television arm in the united states , had approached the bbc about such a venture as early as july 1989 , while the 26th series was still in production segal 's negotiations eventually led to a doctor who television film , broadcast on the fox network in 1996 as a co production between fox , universal pictures , the bbc and bbc worldwide although the film was successful in the uk \( with 9 1 million viewers \) , it was less so in the united states and did not lead to a series
doctor who finally returned with the episode rose on bbc one on 26 march 2005 there have since been nine further series in 2006 2008 and 2010 2015 , and christmas day specials every year since 2005 no full series was filmed in 2009 , although four additional specials starring david tennant were made in 2010 , steven moffat replaced davies as head writer and executive producer in january 2016 , moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale , to be replaced by chris chibnall in 2018 in addition , series 10 will debut in spring 2017 , with a christmas special broadcast in 2016
the 2005 version of doctor who is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963 1989 series note 2 and the 1996 telefilm this is similar to the 1988 continuation of mission impossible , but differs from most other series relaunches which have either been reboots \( for example , battlestar galactica and bionic woman citation needed \) or set in the same universe as the original but in a different time period and with different characters \( for example , star trek the next generation and spin offs citation needed \)
it has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of us president john f kennedy the previous day whereas in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds the bbc believed that many viewers had missed this introduction to a new series due to the coverage of the assassination , as well as a series of power blackouts across the country , and they broadcast it again on 30 november 1963 , just before episode two
the phrase hiding behind \( or 'watching from behind' \) the sofa entered british pop culture , signifying in humour the stereotypical early series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it the phrase retains this association with doctor who , to the point that in 1991 the museum of the moving image in london named their exhibition celebrating the programme behind the sofa the electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie , novel , and frightening , at the time a 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill at the center of many people 's relationship with the show , and a 2011 online vote at digital spy deemed the series the scariest tv show of all time
a bbc audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that , by their own definition of violence \( any act s which may cause physical and or psychological injury , hurt or death to persons , animals or property , whether intentional or accidental \) doctor who was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time the same report found that 3 of the surveyed audience regarded the show as very unsuitable for family viewing responding to the findings of the survey in the times newspaper , journalist philip howard maintained that , to compare the violence of dr who , sired by a horse laugh out of a nightmare , with the more realistic violence of other television series , where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood , is like comparing monopoly with the property market in london both are fantasies , but one is meant to be taken seriously
the image of the tardis has become firmly linked to the show in the public 's consciousness bbc scriptwriter anthony coburn , who lived in the resort of herne bay , kent , was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine in 1996 , the bbc applied for a trade mark to use the tardis' blue police box design in merchandising associated with doctor who in 1998 , the metropolitan police authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim but in 2002 , the patent office ruled in favour of the bbc

between about 1964 and 1973 , large amounts of older material stored in the bbc 's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed , note 3 wiped , or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from broadcast quality this included many old episodes of doctor who , mostly stories featuring the first two doctors william hartnell and patrick troughton in all , 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the bbc 's archives \( most notably seasons 3 , 4 , 5 , from which 79 episodes are missing \) in 1972 , almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the bbc , while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying spare film copies had been brought to a stop

producers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character this was first prompted by original star william hartnell 's poor health the actual term regeneration was not initially conceived of until the doctor 's third on screen regeneration however hartnell 's doctor had merely described undergoing a renewal , and the second doctor underwent a change of appearance citation needed the device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show 's history , as well as the depiction of alternative doctors either from the doctor 's relative past or future citation needed
the serials the deadly assassin and mawdryn undead and the 1996 tv film would later establish that a time lord can only regenerate 12 times , for a total of 13 incarnations this line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated , and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the doctor a thirteenth time the episode the time of the doctor depicted the doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations , starting from the twelfth doctor , due to the eleventh doctor being the product of the doctor 's twelfth regeneration from his original set

in 1271 , kublai khan imposed the name great yuan \( chinese pinyin d yu n wade giles ta y an \) , establishing the yuan dynasty d yu n \( \) is from the sentence \( d zai qi n yu n great is qi n , the primal \) in the commentaries on the classic of changes \( i ching \) section regarding qi n \( \) the counterpart in mongolian language was dai n ulus , also rendered as ikh yuan ls or yekhe yuan ulus in mongolian , dai n \( great yuan \) is often used in conjunction with the yeke mongghul ulus \( lit great mongol state \) , resulting in dai n yeke mongghul ulus \( mongolian script \) , meaning great yuan great mongol state the yuan dynasty is also known as the mongol dynasty or mongol dynasty of china , similar to the names manchu dynasty or manchu dynasty of china for the qing dynasty furthermore , the yuan is sometimes known as the empire of the great khan or khanate of the great khan , which particularly appeared on some yuan maps , since yuan emperors held the nominal title of great khan nevertheless , both terms can also refer to the khanate within the mongol empire directly ruled by great khans before the actual establishment of the yuan dynasty by kublai khan in 1271
genghis khan united the mongol and turkic tribes of the steppes and became great khan in 1206 he and his successors expanded the mongol empire across asia under the reign of genghis' third son , gedei khan , the mongols destroyed the weakened jin dynasty in 1234 , conquering most of northern china gedei offered his nephew kublai a position in xingzhou , hebei kublai was unable to read chinese but had several han chinese teachers attached to him since his early years by his mother sorghaghtani he sought the counsel of chinese buddhist and confucian advisers m ngke khan succeeded gedei 's son , g y k , as great khan in 1251 he granted his brother kublai control over mongol held territories in china kublai built schools for confucian scholars , issued paper money , revived chinese rituals , and endorsed policies that stimulated agricultural and commercial growth he adopted as his capital city kaiping in inner mongolia , later renamed shangdu
many han chinese and khitan defected to the mongols to fight against the jin two han chinese leaders , shi tianze , liu heima \( , liu ni \) , and the khitan xiao zhala \( \) defected and commanded the 3 tumens in the mongol army liu heima and shi tianze served og dei khan liu heima and shi tianxiang led armies against western xia for the mongols there were 4 han tumens and 3 khitan tumens , with each tumen consisting of 10 , 000 troops the three khitan generals shimobeidier \( \) , tabuyir \( \) and xiaozhacizhizizhongxi \( \) commanded the three khitan tumens and the four han generals zhang rou , yan shi , shi tianze , and liu heima commanded the four han tumens under og dei khan
shi tianze was a han chinese who lived in the jin dynasty interethnic marriage between han and jurchen became common at this time his father was shi bingzhi \( , shih ping chih \) shi bingzhi was married to a jurchen woman \( surname na ho \) and a han chinese woman \( surname chang \) it is unknown which of them was shi tianze 's mother shi tianze was married to two jurchen women , a han chinese woman , and a korean woman , and his son shi gang was born to one of his jurchen wives the surnames of his jurchen wives were mo nien and na ho the surname of his korean wife was li and the surname of his han chinese wife was shi shi tianze defected to mongol forces upon their invasion of the jin dynasty his son shi gang married a kerait woman the kerait were mongolified turkic people and were considered part of the mongol nation shi tianze \( shih t'ien tse \) , zhang rou \( chang jou , \) , and yan shi \( yen shih , \) and other high ranking chinese who served in the jin dynasty and defected to the mongols helped build the structure for the administration of the new state chagaan \( tsagaan \) and zhang rou jointly launched an attack on the song dynasty ordered by t regene khatun
m ngke khan commenced a military campaign against the chinese song dynasty in southern china the mongol force that invaded southern china was far greater than the force they sent to invade the middle east in 1256 he died in 1259 without a successor kublai returned from fighting the song in 1260 when he learned that his brother , ariq b ke , was challenging his claim to the throne kublai convened a kurultai in kaiping that elected him great khan a rival kurultai in mongolia proclaimed ariq b ke great khan , beginning a civil war kublai depended on the cooperation of his chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources he bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional chinese dynasties and adopting the chinese era name of zhongtong ariq b ke was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered in 1264 all of the three western khanates \( golden horde , chagatai khanate and ilkhanate \) became functionally autonomous , although only the ilkhans truly recognized kublai as great khan civil strife had permanently divided the mongol empire
instability troubled the early years of kublai khan 's reign ogedei 's grandson kaidu refused to submit to kublai and threatened the western frontier of kublai 's domain the hostile but weakened song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south kublai secured the northeast border in 1259 by installing the hostage prince wonjong as the ruler of korea , making it a mongol tributary state kublai was also threatened by domestic unrest li tan , the son in law of a powerful official , instigated a revolt against mongol rule in 1262 after successfully suppressing the revolt , kublai curbed the influence of the han chinese advisers in his court he feared that his dependence on chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the song
kublai 's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving mongol interests in china and satisfying the demands of his chinese subjects he instituted the reforms proposed by his chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy , expanding the circulation of paper money , and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron he restored the imperial secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past chinese dynasties unchanged however , kublai rejected plans to revive the confucian imperial examinations and divided yuan society into three , later four , classes with the han chinese occupying the lowest rank kublai 's chinese advisers still wielded significant power in the government , but their official rank was nebulous
kublai readied the move of the mongol capital from karakorum in mongolia to khanbaliq in 1264 , constructing a new city near the former jurchen capital zhongdu , now modern beijing , in 1266 in 1271 , kublai formally claimed the mandate of heaven and declared that 1272 was the first year of the great yuan \( chinese \) in the style of a traditional chinese dynasty the name of the dynasty originated from the i ching and describes the origin of the universe or a primal force kublai proclaimed khanbaliq the great capital or daidu \( dadu , chinese in chinese \) of the dynasty the era name was changed to zhiyuan to herald a new era of chinese history the adoption of a dynastic name legitimized mongol rule by integrating the government into the narrative of traditional chinese political succession khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of confucian propriety and ancestor veneration , while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes
kublai khan promoted commercial , scientific , and cultural growth he supported the merchants of the silk road trade network by protecting the mongol postal system , constructing infrastructure , providing loans that financed trade caravans , and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes \( , chao \) pax mongolica , mongol peace , enabled the spread of technologies , commodities , and culture between china and the west kublai expanded the grand canal from southern china to daidu in the north mongol rule was cosmopolitan under kublai khan he welcomed foreign visitors to his court , such as the venetian merchant marco polo , who wrote the most influential european account of yuan china marco polo 's travels would later inspire many others like christopher columbus to chart a passage to the far east in search of its legendary wealth
during the southern song dynasty the descendant of confucius at qufu , the duke yansheng kong duanyou fled south with the song emperor to quzhou , while the newly established jin dynasty \( 1115 1234 \) in the north appointed kong duanyou 's brother kong duancao who remained in qufu as duke yansheng from that time up until the yuan dynasty , there were two duke yanshengs , once in the north in qufu and the other in the south at quzhou during the yuan dynasty , the emperor kublai khan invited the southern duke yansheng kong zhu to return to qufu kong zhu refused , and gave up the title , so the northern branch of the family kept the title of duke yansheng the southern branch still remained in quzhou where they lived to this day confucius 's descendants in quzhou alone number 30 , 000 during the yuan dynasty , one of confucius' descendants moved from china to goryeo era korea and established a branch of the family there after marrying a korean woman
after strengthening his government in northern china , kublai pursued an expansionist policy in line with the tradition of mongol and chinese imperialism he renewed a massive drive against the song dynasty to the south kublai besieged xiangyang between 1268 and 1273 , the last obstacle in his way to capture the rich yangzi river basin an unsuccessful naval expedition was undertaken against japan in 1274 kublai captured the song capital of hangzhou in 1276 , the wealthiest city of china song loyalists escaped from the capital and enthroned a young child as emperor bing of song the mongols defeated the loyalists at the battle of yamen in 1279 the last song emperor drowned , bringing an end to the song dynasty the conquest of the song reunited northern and southern china for the first time in three hundred years
kublai 's government faced financial difficulties after 1279 wars and construction projects had drained the mongol treasury efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems kublai 's second invasion of japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon kublai botched his campaigns against annam , champa , and java , but won a pyrrhic victory against burma the expeditions were hampered by disease , an inhospitable climate , and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the mongols the tran dynasty which ruled annam \( dai viet \) crushed and defeated the mongols at the battle of b ch ng \( 1288 \) the chinese region of fujian was the original home of the chinese tran \( chen \) clan before they migrated under tr n kinh \( , ch n j ng \) to dai viet and whose descendants established the tr n dynasty which ruled vietnam i vi t , and certain members of the clan could still speak chinese such as when a yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the chinese speaking tr n prince tr n qu c tu n \( later king tr n h ng o \) in 1282 professor liam kelley noted that people from song dynasty china like zhao zhong and xu zongdao fled to tran dynasty ruled vietnam after the mongol invasion of the song and they helped the tran fight against the mongol invasion the tran dynasty originated from the fujian region of china as did the daoist cleric xu zongdao who recorded the mongol invasion and referred to them as northern bandits annam , burma , and champa recognized mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the yuan dynasty
following the conquest of dali in 1253 , the former ruling duan dynasty were appointed as governors general , recognized as imperial officials by the yuan , ming , and qing era governments , principally in the province of yunnan succession for the yuan dynasty , however , was an intractable problem , later causing much strife and internal struggle this emerged as early as the end of kublai 's reign kublai originally named his eldest son , zhenjin , as the crown prince , but he died before kublai in 1285 thus , zhenjin 's third son , with the support of his mother k kejin and the minister bayan , succeeded the throne and ruled as tem r khan , or emperor chengzong , from 1294 to 1307 tem r khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather he also made peace with the western mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as vietnam , which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades however , the corruption in the yuan dynasty began during the reign of tem r khan
the fourth yuan emperor , buyantu khan \( ayurbarwada \) , was a competent emperor he was the first yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream chinese culture after the reign of kublai , to the discontent of some mongol elite he had been mentored by li meng , a confucian academic he made many reforms , including the liquidation of the department of state affairs \( chinese \) , which resulted in the execution of five of the highest ranking officials starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials , testing their knowledge on significant historical works also , he codified much of the law , as well as publishing or translating a number of chinese books and works
emperor gegeen khan , ayurbarwada 's son and successor , ruled for only two years , from 1321 to 1323 he continued his father 's policies to reform the government based on the confucian principles , with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor baiju during his reign , the da yuan tong zhi \( chinese , the comprehensive institutions of the great yuan \) , a huge collection of codes and regulations of the yuan dynasty begun by his father , was formally promulgated gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction , perhaps steppe elite opposed to confucian reforms they placed yes n tem r \( or taidingdi \) on the throne , and , after an unsuccessful attempt to calm the princes , he also succumbed to regicide
when yes n tem r died in shangdu in 1328 , tugh tem r was recalled to khanbaliq by the qipchaq commander el tem r he was installed as the emperor \( emperor wenzong \) in khanbaliq , while yes n tem r 's son ragibagh succeeded to the throne in shangdu with the support of yes n tem r 's favorite retainer dawlat shah gaining support from princes and officers in northern china and some other parts of the dynasty , khanbaliq based tugh tem r eventually won the civil war against ragibagh known as the war of the two capitals afterwards , tugh tem r abdicated in favour of his brother kusala , who was backed by chagatai khan eljigidey , and announced khanbaliq 's intent to welcome him however , kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with tugh tem r he was supposedly killed with poison by el tem r , and tugh tem r then remounted the throne tugh tem r also managed to send delegates to the western mongol khanates such as golden horde and ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of mongol world however , he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official el tem r during his latter three year reign el tem r purged pro kusala officials and brought power to warlords , whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty
due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by el tem r , tugh tem r is known for his cultural contribution instead he adopted many measures honoring confucianism and promoting chinese cultural values his most concrete effort to patronize chinese learning was founding the academy of the pavilion of the star of literature \( chinese \) , first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake a number of tasks relating to the transmission of confucian high culture to the mongolian imperial establishment the academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books , but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named jingshi dadian \( chinese \) tugh tem r supported zhu xi 's neo confucianism and also devoted himself in buddhism
after the death of tugh tem r in 1332 and subsequent death of rinchinbal \( emperor ningzong \) the same year , the 13 year old toghun tem r \( emperor huizong \) , the last of the nine successors of kublai khan , was summoned back from guangxi and succeeded to the throne after el tem r 's death , bayan became as powerful an official as el tem r had been in the beginning of his long reign as toghun tem r grew , he came to disapprove of bayan 's autocratic rule in 1340 he allied himself with bayan 's nephew toqto'a , who was in discord with bayan , and banished bayan by coup with the dismissal of bayan , toghtogha seized the power of the court his first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit he also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government one of his successful projects was to finish the long stalled official histories of the liao , jin , and song dynasties , which were eventually completed in 1345 yet , toghtogha resigned his office with the approval of toghun tem r , marking the end of his first administration , and he was not called back until 1349
the final years of the yuan dynasty were marked by struggle , famine , and bitterness among the populace in time , kublai khan 's successors lost all influence on other mongol lands across asia , while the mongols beyond the middle kingdom saw them as too chinese gradually , they lost influence in china as well the reigns of the later yuan emperors were short and marked by intrigues and rivalries uninterested in administration , they were separated from both the army and the populace , and china was torn by dissension and unrest outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening yuan armies
from the late 1340s onwards , people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts , floods and the resulting famines , and the government 's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support in 1351 , the red turban rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising in 1354 , when toghtogha led a large army to crush the red turban rebels , toghun tem r suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal this resulted in toghun tem r 's restoration of power on the one hand and a rapid weakening of the central government on the other he had no choice but to rely on local warlords' military power , and gradually lost his interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles he fled north to shangdu from khanbaliq \( present day beijing \) in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the m ng dynasty \( 1368 1644 \) , founded by zhu yuanzhang in the south he had tried to regain khanbaliq , which eventually failed he died in yingchang \( located in present day inner mongolia \) two years later \( 1370 \) yingchang was seized by the ming shortly after his death some royal family members still lived in henan today
a rich cultural diversity developed during the yuan dynasty the major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular the political unity of china and much of central asia promoted trade between east and west the mongols' extensive west asian and european contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange the other cultures and peoples in the mongol world empire also very much influenced china it had significantly eased trade and commerce across asia until its decline the communications between yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in persia , the ilkhanate , encouraged this development buddhism had a great influence in the yuan government , and the tibetan rite tantric buddhism had significantly influenced china during this period the muslims of the yuan dynasty introduced middle eastern cartography , astronomy , medicine , clothing , and diet in east asia eastern crops such as carrots , turnips , new varieties of lemons , eggplants , and melons , high quality granulated sugar , and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the yuan dynasty
western musical instruments were introduced to enrich chinese performing arts from this period dates the conversion to islam , by muslims of central asia , of growing numbers of chinese in the northwest and southwest nestorianism and roman catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration buddhism \( especially tibetan buddhism \) flourished , although taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of buddhism from the yuan government confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the classics , which had fallen into disuse in north china during the period of disunity , were reinstated by the yuan court , probably in the hope of maintaining order over han society advances were realized in the fields of travel literature , cartography , geography , and scientific education
the first recorded travels by europeans to china and back date from this time the most famous traveler of the period was the venetian marco polo , whose account of his trip to cambaluc , the capital of the great khan , and of life there astounded the people of europe the account of his travels , il milione \( or , the million , known in english as the travels of marco polo \) , appeared about the year 1299 some argue over the accuracy of marco polo 's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the great wall of china , tea houses , which would have been a prominent sight since europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture , as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the great khan some suggest that marco polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with persian traders since many of the places he named were in persian
the yuan undertook extensive public works among kublai khan 's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer guo shoujing , who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365 2425 days of the year , which was only 26 seconds off the modern gregorian calendar 's measurement road and water communications were reorganized and improved to provide against possible famines , granaries were ordered built throughout the empire the city of beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes , hills and mountains , and parks during the yuan period , beijing became the terminus of the grand canal of china , which was completely renovated these commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout asia and facilitated direct chinese contacts with europe chinese travelers to the west were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering contacts with the west also brought the introduction to china of a major food crop , sorghum , along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation
the yuan dynasty was the first time that non native chinese people ruled all of china in the historiography of mongolia , it is generally considered to be the continuation of the mongol empire mongols are widely known to worship the eternal heaven , and according to the traditional mongolian ideology yuan is considered to be the beginning of an infinite number of beings , the foundation of peace and happiness , state power , the dream of many peoples , besides it there is nothing great or precious in traditional historiography of china , on the other hand , the yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the song dynasty and the ming dynasty note , however , yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the mongol empire before kublai khan 's formal establishment of the yuan in 1271 , partly because kublai had his grandfather genghis khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or taizu \( chinese \) despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views \( including the government of the ming dynasty which overthrew the yuan dynasty \) , there also exist chinese people who \? who did not consider the yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of china , but rather as a period of foreign domination the latter believe that han chinese were treated as second class citizens , citation needed and that china stagnated economically and scientifically
the system of bureaucracy created by kublai khan reflected various cultures in the empire , including that of the han chinese , khitans , jurchens , mongols , and tibetan buddhists while the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native chinese dynasties , the yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures the chinese style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native tang , song , as well as khitan liao and jurchen jin dynasties chinese advisers such as liu bingzhong and yao shu gave strong influence to kublai 's early court , and the central government administration was established within the first decade of kublai 's reign this government adopted the traditional chinese tripartite division of authority among civil , military , and censorial offices , including the central secretariat \( zhongshu sheng \) to manage civil affairs , the privy council \( chinese \) to manage military affairs , and the censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection the actual functions of both central and local government institutions , however , showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions , due to the mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance nevertheless , such a civilian bureaucracy , with the central secretariat as the top institution that was \( directly or indirectly \) responsible for most other governmental agencies \( such as the traditional chinese style six ministries \) , was created in china at various times another central government institution called the department of state affairs \( shangshu sheng \) that mainly dealt with finance was established \( such as during the reign of k l g khan or emperor wuzong \) , but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards
while the existence of these central government departments and the six ministries \( which had been introduced since the sui and tang dynasties \) gave a sinicized image in the yuan administration , the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions for example , the authority of the yuan legal system , the ministry of justice , did not extend to legal cases involving mongols and semuren , who had separate courts of justice cases involving members of more than one ethnic group were decided by a mixed board consisting of chinese and mongols another example was the insignificance of the ministry of war compared with native chinese dynasties , as the real military authority in yuan times resided in the privy council
since its invention in 1269 , the 'phags pa script , a unified script for spelling mongolian , tibetan , and chinese languages , was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty most of the emperors could not master written chinese , but they could generally converse well in the language the mongol custom of long standing quda marriage alliance with mongol clans , the onggirat , and the ikeres , kept the imperial blood purely mongol until the reign of tugh temur , whose mother was a tangut concubine the mongol emperors had built large palaces and pavilions , but some still continued to live as nomads at times nevertheless , a few other yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities an example is tugh temur \( emperor wenzong \) , who wrote poetry , painted , read chinese classical texts , and ordered the compilation of books
the average mongol garrison family of the yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure , with income from the harvests of their chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty the mongols practiced debt slavery , and by 1290 in all parts of the mongol empire commoners were selling their children into slavery seeing this as damaging to the mongol nation , kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of mongols kublai wished to persuade the chinese that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his mongolian credentials with his own people he set up a civilian administration to rule , built a capital within china , supported chinese religions and culture , and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court but at the same time he never abandoned his mongolian heritage
in the china of the yuan , or mongol era , various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development , including the areas of painting , mathematics , calligraphy , poetry , and theater , with many great artists and writers being famous today due to the coming together of painting , poetry , and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals , though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting , poetry , and calligraphy , the song dynasty and the yuan dynasty are linked together in the area of chinese painting during the yuan dynasty there were many famous painters in the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the yuan dynasty era in yuan poetry , the main development was the qu , which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous yuan poets many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time , and the other way around , with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu one of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form one of the important cultural developments during the yuan era was the consolidation of poetry , painting , and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical chinese art another important aspect of yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current , vernacular chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show another important consideration regarding yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in china , relatively to works from the tang dynasty and song dynasty , which have often been better preserved in places such as the sh s in , in japan
there were many religions practiced during the yuan dynasty , such as buddhism , islam , and christianity the establishment of the yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of muslims in china however , unlike the western khanates , the yuan dynasty never converted to islam instead , kublai khan , the founder of the yuan dynasty , favored buddhism , especially the tibetan variants as a result , tibetan buddhism was established as the de facto state religion the top level department and government agency known as the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs \( xuanzheng yuan \) was set up in khanbaliq \( modern beijing \) to supervise buddhist monks throughout the empire since kublai khan only esteemed the sakya sect of tibetan buddhism , other religions became less important he and his successors kept a sakya imperial preceptor \( dishi \) at court before the end of the yuan dynasty , 14 leaders of the sakya sect had held the post of imperial preceptor , thereby enjoying special power furthermore , mongol patronage of buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of buddhist art mongolian buddhist translations , almost all from tibetan originals , began on a large scale after 1300 many mongols of the upper class such as the jalayir and the oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized confucian scholars and institutions a considerable number of confucian and chinese historical works were translated into the mongolian language
advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the yuan era the mathematician zhu shijie \( 1249 1314 \) solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients , equivalent to modern matrices zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown his method is described in the jade mirror of the four unknowns , written in 1303 the opening pages contain a diagram of pascal 's triangle the summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book
guo shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars he was one of the first mathematicians in china to work on spherical trigonometry gou derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations his calendar , the shoushi li \( \) or calendar for fixing the seasons , was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the yuan dynasty the calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of song dynasty astronomer shen kuo or possibly by the work of arab astronomers there are no explicit signs of muslim influences in the shoushi calendar , but mongol rulers were known to be interested in muslim calendars mathematical knowledge from the middle east was introduced to china under the mongols , and muslim astronomers brought arabic numerals to china in the 13th century
the physicians of the yuan court came from diverse cultures healers were divided into non mongol physicians called otachi and traditional mongol shamans the mongols characterized otachi doctors by their use of herbal remedies , which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of mongol shamanism physicians received official support from the yuan government and were given special legal privileges kublai created the imperial academy of medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with confucian virtues
the chinese medical tradition of the yuan had four great schools that the yuan inherited from the jin dynasty all four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation , but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine under the mongols , the practice of chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the mongols as they expanded towards the west chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture , moxibustion , pulse diagnosis , and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the middle east and the rest of the empire several medical advances were made in the yuan period the physician wei yilin \( 1277 1347 \) invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints , which he performed using anesthetics the mongol physician hu sihui described the importance of a healthy diet in a 1330 medical treatise
western medicine was also practiced in china by the nestorian christians of the yuan court , where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or muslim medicine the nestorian physician jesus the interpreter founded the office of western medicine in 1263 during the reign of kublai huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court chinese physicians opposed western medicine because its humoral system contradicted the yin yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional chinese medicine no chinese translation of western medical works is known , but it is possible that the chinese had access to avicenna 's the canon of medicine
the mongol rulers patronized the yuan printing industry chinese printing technology was transferred to the mongols through kingdom of qocho and tibetan intermediaries some yuan documents such as wang zhen 's nong shu were printed with earthenware movable type , a technology invented in the 12th century however , most published works were still produced through traditional block printing techniques the publication of a taoist text inscribed with the name of t regene khatun , gedei 's wife , is one of the first printed works sponsored by the mongols in 1273 , the mongols created the imperial library directorate , a government sponsored printing office the yuan government established centers for printing throughout china local schools and government agencies were funded to support the publishing of books
one of the more notable applications of printing technology was the chao , the paper money of the yuan chao were made from the bark of mulberry trees the yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money , but switched to bronze plates in 1275 the mongols experimented with establishing the chinese style paper monetary system in mongol controlled territories outside of china the yuan minister bolad was sent to iran , where he explained yuan paper money to the il khanate court of gaykhatu the il khanate government issued paper money in 1294 , but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment
politically , the system of government created by kublai khan was the product of a compromise between mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional chinese autocratic bureaucratic system nevertheless , socially the educated chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native chinese dynasties although the traditional chinese elite were not given their share of power , the mongols and the semuren \( various allied groups from central asia and the western end of the empire \) largely remained strangers to the mainstream chinese culture , and this dichotomy gave the yuan regime a somewhat strong colonial coloration the unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic chinese under their rule the mongols and semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty , and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century in general there were very few north chinese or southerners reaching the highest post in the government compared with the possibility that persians did so in the ilkhanate later the yongle emperor of the ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the yuan dynasty in response to an objection against the use of barbarians in his government , the yongle emperor answered discrimination was used by the mongols during the yuan dynasty , who employed only mongols and tartars and discarded northern and southern chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them
at the same time the mongols imported central asian muslims to serve as administrators in china , the mongols also sent han chinese and khitans from china to serve as administrators over the muslim population in bukhara in central asia , using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands han chinese were moved to central asian areas like besh baliq , almaliq , and samarqand by the mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers alans were recruited into the mongol forces with one unit called right alan guard which was combined with recently surrendered soldiers , mongols , and chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former kingdom of qocho and in besh balikh the mongols established a chinese military colony led by chinese general qi kongzhi \( ch'i kung chih \) after the mongol conquest of central asia by genghis khan , foreigners were chosen as administrators and co management with chinese and qara khitays \( khitans \) of gardens and fields in samarqand was put upon the muslims as a requirement since muslims were not allowed to manage without them the mongol appointed governor of samarqand was a qara khitay \( khitan \) , held the title taishi , familiar with chinese culture his name was ahai
despite the high position given to muslims , some policies of the yuan emperors severely discriminated against them , restricting halal slaughter and other islamic practices like circumcision , as well as kosher butchering for jews , forcing them to eat food the mongol way toward the end , corruption and the persecution became so severe that muslim generals joined han chinese in rebelling against the mongols the ming founder zhu yuanzhang had muslim generals like lan yu who rebelled against the mongols and defeated them in combat some muslim communities had a chinese surname which meant barracks and could also mean thanks many hui muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the mongols and it was given in thanks by the han chinese for assisting them during the war fighting the mongols , among the ming emperor zhu yuanzhang 's armies was the hui muslim feng sheng the muslims in the semu class also revolted against the yuan dynasty in the ispah rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the muslims were massacred by the yuan loyalist commander chen youding
the historian frederick w mote wrote that the usage of the term social classes for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth , but just entailed degrees of privilege to which they were entitled institutionally and legally , so a person 's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing , since there were rich and well socially standing chinese while there were less rich mongol and semu than there were mongol and semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated
the reason for the order of the classes and the reason why people were placed in a certain class was the date they surrendered to the mongols , and had nothing to do with their ethnicity the earlier they surrendered to the mongols , the higher they were placed , the more the held out , the lower they were ranked the northern chinese were ranked higher and southern chinese were ranked lower because southern china withstood and fought to the last before caving in major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern chinese manufacturers and merchants
when the mongols placed the uighurs of the kingdom of qocho over the koreans at the court the korean king objected , then the mongol emperor kublai khan rebuked the korean king , saying that the uighur king of qocho was ranked higher than the karluk kara khanid ruler , who in turn was ranked higher than the korean king , who was ranked last , because the uighurs surrendered to the mongols first , the karluks surrendered after the uighurs , and the koreans surrendered last , and that the uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting
the central region , consisting of present day hebei , shandong , shanxi , the south eastern part of present day inner mongolia and the henan areas to the north of the yellow river , was considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly governed by the central secretariat \( or zhongshu sheng \) at khanbaliq \( modern beijing \) similarly , another top level administrative department called the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs \( or xuanzheng yuan \) held administrative rule over the whole of modern day tibet and a part of sichuan , qinghai and kashmir

the republic of kenya is named after mount kenya the origin of the name kenya is not clear , but perhaps linked to the kikuyu , embu and kamba words kirinyaga , kirenyaa and kiinyaa which mean god 's resting place in all three languages if so , then the british may not so much have mispronounced it \( 'keenya' \) , as misspelled it prehistoric volcanic eruptions of mount kenya \( now extinct \) may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous bantu ethnic groups , who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding mount kenya original research \?

in 1981 , the presidential working party on the second university was commissioned to look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system the committee recommended that the 7 4 2 3 system be changed to an 8 4 4 system \( eight years in primary , four years in secondary , and four years in university education \) the table under present day education in kenya below shows the structure of the 8 4 4 system although the 7 4 2 3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8 4 4 system in 1985 , the last batch of students from the former system graduated from kenyan universities in 1992
the current 8 4 4 system was launched in january 1985 it put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school drop outs at all levels either to be self employed or to secure employment in the informal sector in january 2003 , the government of kenya announced the introduction of free primary education as a result , primary school enrolment increased by about 70 secondary and tertiary education enrolment has not increased proportionally because payment is still required for attendance in 2007 the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008 , secondary education would be heavily subsidiszed , with the government footing all tuition fees
basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years comprising eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school primary school is free in public schools and those who exit at this level can join a vocational youth village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring , carpentry , motor vehicle repair , brick laying and masonry for about two years those who complete high school can join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to the university and study for four years graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialised higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training , or join the university usually in the second or third year of their respective course the higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor 's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post graduate studies is possible in some universities
the country 's literacy level stands at 85 of the whole population preschool , which targets children from age three to five , is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to standard one \( first grade \) at the end of primary education , pupils sit the kenya certificate of primary education \( kcpe \) , which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training the result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school primary school age is 6 7 13 14 years for those who proceed to secondary level , there is a national examination at the end of form four the kenya certificate of secondary education \( kcse \) , which determines those proceeding to the universities , other professional training or employment students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing however , english , kiswahili \( languages \) and mathematics are compulsory subjects
other than the curriculum led learning , there are also national and public library services led by the kenya national library service \( knls \) knls is the body mandated to establish , equip , manage and maintain national and public libraries in the country in addition , some of the counties within the country have either established or taken over libraries within their regions nairobi county operates four libraries within their network , which included the mcmillan memorial library located at the central business district of nairobi a public library is seen as a peoples university since it is open to all irrespective of age , literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life
kenya is active in several sports , among them cricket , rallying , football , rugby union and boxing the country is known chiefly for its dominance in middle distance and long distance athletics , having consistently produced olympic and commonwealth games champions in various distance events , especially in 800 m , 1 , 500 m , 3 , 000 m steeplechase , 5 , 000 m , 10 , 000 m and the marathon kenyan athletes \( particularly kalenjin \) continue to dominate the world of distance running , although competition from morocco and ethiopia has reduced this supremacy kenya 's best known athletes included the four time women 's boston marathon winner and two time world champion catherine ndereba , 800m world record holder david rudisha , former marathon world record holder paul tergat , and john ngugi
kenya won several medals during the beijing olympics , six gold , four silver and four bronze , making it africa 's most successful nation in the 2008 olympics new athletes gained attention , such as pamela jelimo , the women 's 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the iaaf golden league jackpot , and samuel wanjiru who won the men 's marathon retired olympic and commonwealth games champion kipchoge keino helped usher in kenya 's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by commonwealth champion henry rono 's spectacular string of world record performances lately , there has been controversy in kenyan athletics circles , with the defection of a number of kenyan athletes to represent other countries , chiefly bahrain and qatar the kenyan ministry of sports has tried to stop the defections , but they have continued anyway , with bernard lagat the latest , choosing to represent the united states most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors some elite kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country 's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries citation needed
kenya has been a dominant force in women 's volleyball within africa , with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade citation needed the women 's team has competed at the olympics and world championships but without any notable success cricket is another popular and the most successful team sport kenya has competed in the cricket world cup since 1996 they upset some of the world 's best teams and reached semi finals of the 2003 tournament they won the inaugural world cricket league division 1 hosted in nairobi and participated in the world t20 their current captain is rakep patel they participated in the icc cricket world cup 2011 kenya is represented by lucas onyango as a professional rugby league player who plays with oldham roughyeds besides the former european super league team , he has played for widnes vikings and rugby union with sale sharks rugby union is increasing in popularity , especially with the annual safari sevens tournament kenya sevens team ranked 9th in irb sevens world series for the 2006 season kenya was also a regional powerhouse in soccer however , its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct kenya football federation , leading to a suspension by fifa which was lifted in march 2007
in the motor rallying arena , kenya is home to the world famous safari rally , commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world it was a part of the world rally championship for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally , such as bj rn waldeg rd , hannu mikkola , tommi m kinen , shekhar mehta , carlos sainz and colin mcrae although the rally still runs annually as part of the africa rally championship , the organisers are hoping to be allowed to rejoin the world rally championship in the next couple of years
kenyans generally have three meals in a day breakfast in the morning \( kiamsha kinywa \) , lunch in the afternoon \( chakula cha mchana \) and supper in the evening \( chakula cha jioni or known simply as chajio \) in between , they have the 10 o'clock tea \( chai ya saa nne \) and 4 pm tea \( chai ya saa kumi \) breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread , chapati , mahamri , boiled sweet potatoes or yams ugali with vegetables , sour milk , meat , fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper regional variations and dishes also exist
the intergovernmental panel on climate change \( ipcc \) is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the united nations , set up at the request of member governments it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations , the world meteorological organization \( wmo \) and the united nations environment programme \( unep \) , and later endorsed by the united nations general assembly through resolution 43 53 membership of the ipcc is open to all members of the wmo and unep the ipcc produces reports that support the united nations framework convention on climate change \( unfccc \) , which is the main international treaty on climate change the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic i e , human induced interference with the climate system ipcc reports cover the scientific , technical and socio economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human induced climate change , its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation
korean economist hoesung lee is the chair of the ipcc since october 8 , 2015 , following the election of the new ipcc bureau before this election , the ipcc was led by his vice chair ismail el gizouli , who was designated acting chair after the resignation of rajendra k pachauri in february 2015 the previous chairs were rajendra k pachauri , elected in may 2002 robert watson in 1997 and bert bolin in 1988 the chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice chairs , working group co chairs , and a secretariat
the ipcc panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged plenary sessions of the ipcc and ipcc working groups are held at the level of government representatives non governmental and intergovernmental organizations may be allowed to attend as observers sessions of the ipcc bureau , workshops , expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts after the opening ceremonies , closed plenary sessions were held the meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at sessions with about seven eighths of participants being from governmental organizations
the ipcc receives funding through the ipcc trust fund , established in 1989 by the united nations environment programme \( unep \) and the world meteorological organization \( wmo \) , costs of the secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the wmo , while unep meets the cost of the depute secretary annual cash contributions to the trust fund are made by the wmo , by unep , and by ipcc members the scale of payments is determined by the ipcc panel , which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget the organisation is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the wmo
the ipcc does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data lead authors of ipcc reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources according to ipcc guidelines , authors should give priority to peer reviewed sources authors may refer to non peer reviewed sources \( the grey literature \) , provided that they are of sufficient quality examples of non peer reviewed sources include model results , reports from government agencies and non governmental organizations , and industry journals each subsequent ipcc report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required
each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material a chapter typically has two coordinating lead authors , ten to fifteen lead authors , and a somewhat larger number of contributing authors the coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors , ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements , and reporting to the working group chairs lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters contributing authors prepare text , graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors
the executive summary of the wg i summary for policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases , resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth 's surface they calculate with confidence that co2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect they predict that under a business as usual \( bau \) scenario , global mean temperature will increase by about 0 3 c per decade during the 21st century they judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0 3 to 0 6 c over the last 100 years , broadly consistent with prediction of climate models , but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more
in 2001 , 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change the joint statement was made by the australian academy of science , the royal flemish academy of belgium for science and the arts , the brazilian academy of sciences , the royal society of canada , the caribbean academy of sciences , the chinese academy of sciences , the french academy of sciences , the german academy of natural scientists leopoldina , the indian national science academy , the indonesian academy of sciences , the royal irish academy , accademia nazionale dei lincei \( italy \) , the academy of sciences malaysia , the academy council of the royal society of new zealand , the royal swedish academy of sciences , and the royal society \( uk \) the statement , also published as an editorial in the journal science , stated we support the tar 's conclusion that it is at least 90 certain that temperatures will continue to rise , with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1 4 and 5 8 c above 1990 levels by 2100 the tar has also been endorsed by the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences , canadian meteorological and oceanographic society , and european geosciences union \( refer to endorsements of the ipcc \)
ipcc author richard lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the tar among his criticisms , lindzen has stated that the wgi summary for policymakers \( spm \) does not faithfully summarize the full wgi report for example , lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with climate models john houghton , who was a co chair of tar wgi , has responded to lindzen 's criticisms of the spm houghton has stressed that the spm is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world 's governments , and that any changes to the spm must be supported by scientific evidence
in addition to climate assessment reports , the ipcc is publishing special reports on specific topics the preparation and approval process for all ipcc special reports follows the same procedures as for ipcc assessment reports in the year 2011 two ipcc special report were finalized , the special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation \( srren \) and the special report on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation \( srex \) both special reports were requested by governments
the ipcc concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function , it also supports other activities , such as the data distribution centre and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme , required under the unfccc this involves publishing default emission factors , which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption , industrial production and so on
this projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers the ipcc has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect , while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust they expressed regret for the poor application of well established ipcc procedures in this instance the date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the ipcc from the wwf report , which has misquoted its own source , an icsi report variations of snow and ice in the past and at present on a global and regional scale
former ipcc chairman robert watson has said the mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact that is worrying the ipcc needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened martin parry , a climate expert who had been co chair of the ipcc working group ii , said that what began with a single unfortunate error over himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance and the ipcc had investigated the other alleged mistakes , which were generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment
the third assessment report \( tar \) prominently featured a graph labeled millennial northern hemisphere temperature reconstruction based on a 1999 paper by michael e mann , raymond s bradley and malcolm k hughes \( mbh99 \) , which has been referred to as the hockey stick graph this graph extended the similar graph in figure 3 20 from the ipcc second assessment report of 1995 , and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units , but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years , and higher temperatures during the medieval warm period than the mid 20th century the schematic was not an actual plot of data , and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central england , with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of medieval vineyards in england even with this increase , the maximum it showed for the medieval warm period did not reach temperatures recorded in central england in 2007 the mbh99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by jones et al 1998 , pollack , huang shen 1998 , crowley lowery 2000 and briffa 2000 , using differing data and methods the jones et al and briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the mbh99 reconstruction in figure 2 21 of the ipcc report
these studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900 , and the mbh99 based graph featured in publicity even at the draft stage , this finding was disputed by contrarians in may 2000 fred singer 's science and environmental policy project held a press event on capitol hill , washington , d c , featuring comments on the graph wibj rn karl n and singer argued against the graph at a united states senate committee on commerce , science and transportation hearing on 18 july 2000 contrarian john lawrence daly featured a modified version of the ipcc 1990 schematic , which he mis identified as appearing in the ipcc 1995 report , and argued that overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report , the ipcc presented the 'hockey stick' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt u turn since its 1995 report criticism of the mbh99 reconstruction in a review paper , which was quickly discredited in the soon and baliunas controversy , was picked up by the bush administration , and a senate speech by us republican senator james inhofe alleged that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people the data and methodology used to produce the hockey stick graph was criticized in papers by stephen mcintyre and ross mckitrick , and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by wahl ammann 2007 , which showed errors in the methods used by mcintyre and mckitrick
on 23 june 2005 , rep joe barton , chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce wrote joint letters with ed whitfield , chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations demanding full records on climate research , as well as personal information about their finances and careers , from mann , bradley and hughes sherwood boehlert , chairman of the house science committee , said this was a misguided and illegitimate investigation apparently aimed at intimidating scientists , and at his request the u s national academy of sciences arranged for its national research council to set up a special investigation the national research council 's report agreed that there were some statistical failings , but these had little effect on the graph , which was generally correct in a 2006 letter to nature , mann , bradley , and hughes pointed out that their original article had said that more widespread high resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article
the ipcc fourth assessment report \( ar4 \) published in 2007 featured a graph showing 12 proxy based temperature reconstructions , including the three highlighted in the 2001 third assessment report \( tar \) mann , bradley hughes 1999 as before , jones et al 1998 and briffa 2000 had both been calibrated by newer studies in addition , analysis of the medieval warm period cited reconstructions by crowley lowery 2000 \( as cited in the tar \) and osborn briffa 2006 ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1 , 000 years or longer most reconstructions shared some data series , particularly tree ring data , but newer reconstructions used additional data and covered a wider area , using a variety of statistical methods the section discussed the divergence problem affecting certain tree ring data
on 1 february 2007 , the eve of the publication of ipcc 's major report on climate , a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last ipcc report in 2001 the study compared ipcc 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations over the six years studied , the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc 's 2001 projection , and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection
another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc , far from overstating dangers and risks , have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels when the researchers' analysis was applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change \( ipcc \) , the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0 5 1 4 m 50 140 cm above 1990 levels these values are much greater than the 9 88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report , published in 2001 this may have been due , in part , to the expanding human understanding of climate
michael oppenheimer , a long time participant in the ipcc and coordinating lead author of the fifth assessment report conceded in science magazine 's state of the planet 2008 2009 some limitations of the ipcc consensus approach and asks for concurring , smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous ipcc assessment reports it has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the ipcc process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties
the ipcc process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges \( compare ozone depletion and global warming \) in case of the ozone depletion global regulation based on the montreal protocol has been successful , in case of climate change , the kyoto protocol failed the ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the ipcc process the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different , if not opposing goals the underlying linear model of policy making of more knowledge we have , the better the political response will be is being doubted
according to sheldon ungar 's comparison with global warming , the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties the ozone case communicated to lay persons with easy to understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture and related to immediate risks with everyday relevance , while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol , varying regional cost benefit analysis and burden sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem in the uk , a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human made climate change
since the ipcc does not carry out its own research , it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies , and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report 's final release in principle , this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report cannot be included in an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing , this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science however , there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next citation needed
in february 2010 , in response to controversies regarding claims in the fourth assessment report , five climate scientists all contributing or lead ipcc report authors wrote in the journal nature calling for changes to the ipcc they suggested a range of new organizational options , from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors , to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body , or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated living wikipedia ipcc other recommendations included that the panel employ a full time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference
chloroplasts' main role is to conduct photosynthesis , where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and converts it and stores it in the energy storage molecules atp and nadph while freeing oxygen from water they then use the atp and nadph to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the calvin cycle chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions , including fatty acid synthesis , much amino acid synthesis , and the immune response in plants the number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like arabidopsis and wheat
chloroplasts are highly dynamic they circulate and are moved around within plant cells , and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity chloroplasts , like mitochondria , contain their own dna , which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division
chloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell they are considered to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium that became a permanent resident in the cell mitochondria are thought to have come from a similar event , where an aerobic prokaryote was engulfed this origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the russian biologist konstantin mereschkowski in 1905 after andreas schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae
cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts they are sometimes called blue green algae even though they are prokaryotes they are a diverse phylum of bacteria capable of carrying out photosynthesis , and are gram negative , meaning that they have two cell membranes cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall , which is thicker than in other gram negative bacteria , and which is located between their two cell membranes like chloroplasts , they have thylakoids within on the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments , including chlorophyll a phycobilins are also common cyanobacterial pigments , usually organized into hemispherical phycobilisomes attached to the outside of the thylakoid membranes \( phycobilins are not shared with all chloroplasts though \)
somewhere around a billion years ago , a free living cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell , either as food or as an internal parasite , but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in the two innermost lipid bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium 's gram negative cell wall , and not the phagosomal membrane from the host , which was probably lost the new cellular resident quickly became an advantage , providing food for the eukaryotic host , which allowed it to live within it over time , the cyanobacterium was assimilated , and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell , and imported back into the chloroplast \( formerly the cyanobacterium \)
these chloroplasts , which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor , are known as primary plastids \( plastid in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplast \) all primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage , the rhodophyte , or red algal chloroplast lineage , or the chloroplastidan , or green chloroplast lineage the second two are the largest , and the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the land plants
the alga cyanophora , a glaucophyte , is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast the glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages , being found in only 13 species , and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes , like their cyanobacterial parent for this reason , glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids , which surround a carboxysome an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in the starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast like cyanobacteria , glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes for these reasons , glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants
rhodoplasts have a double membrane with an intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes , preventing their thylakoids from stacking some contain pyrenoids rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color however , since they also contain the blue green chlorophyll a and other pigments , many are reddish to purple from the combination the red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water as such , some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts , and can appear more greenish rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean , which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast , in the cytoplasm of the red alga
the chloroplastidan chloroplasts , or green chloroplasts , are another large , highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage their host organisms are commonly known as the green algae and land plants they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes , and contain chlorophyll b instead most green chloroplasts are \( obviously \) green , though some are n't , like some forms of h matococcus pluvialis , due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane , and have replaced it with an intermembrane space some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer , though they 've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead
while primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their cyanobacterial ancestor , secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two , as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event , when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast containing alga but failed to digest it much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story the engulfed alga was broken down , leaving only its chloroplast , and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus , forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes the two cyanobacterial membranes , sometimes the eaten alga 's cell membrane , and the phagosomal vacuole from the host 's cell membrane
euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga euglenophyte chloroplasts have three membranes it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost , leaving the cyanobacterial membranes , and the secondary host 's phagosomal membrane euglenophyte chloroplasts have a pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked in groups of three starch is stored in the form of paramylon , which is contained in membrane bound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte
cryptophytes , or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red algal derived chloroplast cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes , the outermost of which is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum they synthesize ordinary starch , which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space outside the original double membrane , in the place that corresponds to the red alga 's cytoplasm inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two
apicomplexans are another group of chromalveolates like the helicosproidia , they 're parasitic , and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast they were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia , but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than chromalveolates the apicomplexans include plasmodium , the malaria parasite many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast , which they inherited from their ancestors other apicomplexans like cryptosporidium have lost the chloroplast completely apicomplexans store their energy in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm , even though they are nonphotosynthetic
apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function , and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids they are bounded by four membranes , but the membranes are not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum the fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar , and apicoplasts are no different they synthesize fatty acids , isopentenyl pyrophosphate , iron sulfur clusters , and carry out part of the heme pathway this makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan related diseases the most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis in fact , apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function , and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate rich medium , they dump the organelle
the most common dinophyte chloroplast is the peridinin type chloroplast , characterized by the carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts , along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2 peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts the peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes \( occasionally two \) , having lost the red algal endosymbiont 's original cell membrane the outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum they contain a pyrenoid , and have triplet stacked thylakoids starch is found outside the chloroplast an important feature of these chloroplasts is that their chloroplast dna is highly reduced and fragmented into many small circles most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus , and only critical photosynthesis related genes remain in the chloroplast
the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages \( including karlodinium and karenia \) lost their original red algal derived chloroplast , and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont karlodinium and karenia probably took up different heterokontophytes because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes , tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast , adding the haptophyte 's cell membrane and the dinophyte 's phagosomal vacuole however , the haptophyte was heavily reduced , stripped of a few membranes and its nucleus , leaving only its chloroplast \( with its original double membrane \) , and possibly one or two additional membranes around it
members of the genus dinophysis have a phycobilin containing chloroplast taken from a cryptophyte however , the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont only the chloroplast seems to have been taken , and the chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes , leaving just a two membraned chloroplast cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to maintain themselves , and dinophysis species grown in cell culture alone cannot survive , so it is possible \( but not confirmed \) that the dinophysis chloroplast is a kleptoplast if so , dinophysis chloroplasts wear out and dinophysis species must continually engulf cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts to replace the old ones
some dinophytes , like kryptoperidinium and durinskia have a diatom \( heterokontophyte \) derived chloroplast these chloroplasts are bounded by up to five membranes , \( depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast , or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it \) the diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little it still retains its original mitochondria , and has endoplasmic reticulum , ribosomes , a nucleus , and of course , red algal derived chloroplasts practically a complete cell , all inside the host 's endoplasmic reticulum lumen however the diatom endosymbiont ca n't store its own food its starch is found in granules in the dinophyte host 's cytoplasm instead the diatom endosymbiont 's nucleus is present , but it probably ca n't be called a nucleomorph because it shows no sign of genome reduction , and might have even been expanded diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times
lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast \( more specifically , a prasinophyte \) lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that 's not from the rhodoplast lineage the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus the endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary endosymbiosis the endosymbiont was a green alga containing a primary chloroplast \( making a secondary chloroplast \)
while most chloroplasts originate from that first set of endosymbiotic events , paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently it is not clear whether that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes being in the early stages of endosymbiosis , paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped blue green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores , descended from the cyanobacterium synechococcus chromatophores cannot survive outside their host chromatophore dna is about a million base pairs long , containing around 850 protein encoding genes far less than the three million base pair synechococcus genome , but much larger than the approximately 150 , 000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast chromatophores have transferred much less of their dna to the nucleus of their host about 0 3 0 8 of the nuclear dna in paulinella is from the chromatophore , compared with 11 14 from the chloroplast in plants
chloroplasts have their own dna , often abbreviated as ctdna , or cpdna it is also known as the plastome its existence was first proved in 1962 , and first sequenced in 1986 when two japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast dna of liverwort and tobacco since then , hundreds of chloroplast dnas from various species have been sequenced , but they 're mostly those of land plants and green algae glaucophytes , red algae , and other algal groups are extremely underrepresented , potentially introducing some bias in views of typical chloroplast dna structure and content
the inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants , and accumulate few mutations similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages \( glaucophyta and rhodophyce \) , suggesting that they predate the chloroplast , though some chloroplast dnas have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats \( making them direct repeats \) it is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome , as chloroplast dnas which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more
the mechanism for chloroplast dna \( cpdna \) replication has not been conclusively determined , but two main models have been proposed scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s the results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast dna replicates using a double displacement loop \( d loop \) as the d loop moves through the circular dna , it adopts a theta intermediary form , also known as a cairns replication intermediate , and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism transcription starts at specific points of origin multiple replication forks open up , allowing replication machinery to transcribe the dna as replication continues , the forks grow and eventually converge the new cpdna structures separate , creating daughter cpdna chromosomes
in cpdna , there are several a g deamination gradients dna becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded when replication forks form , the strand not being copied is single stranded , and thus at risk for a g deamination therefore , gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened \( the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time \) this mechanism is still the leading theory today however , a second theory suggests that most cpdna is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination it further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched , linear , or other complex structures
one of competing model for cpdna replication asserts that most cpdna is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage t4 it has been established that some plants have linear cpdna , such as maize , and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand when the original experiments on cpdna were performed , scientists did notice linear structures however , they attributed these linear forms to broken circles if the branched and complex structures seen in cpdna experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular dna or broken circles , then a d loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate at the same time , homologous recombination does not expand the multiple a g gradients seen in plastomes because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpdna , the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpdna is circular and most likely replicates via a d loop mechanism
endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages even if a chloroplast is eventually lost , the genes it donated to the former host 's nucleus persist , providing evidence for the lost chloroplast 's existence for example , while diatoms \( a heterokontophyte \) now have a red algal derived chloroplast , the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor \( probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too \) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point , which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast
curiously , around half of the protein products of transferred genes are n't even targeted back to the chloroplast many became exaptations , taking on new functions like participating in cell division , protein routing , and even disease resistance a few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome most became nonfunctional pseudogenes , though a few trna genes still work in the mitochondrion some transferred chloroplast dna protein products get directed to the secretory pathway \( though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host 's cell membrane , and therefore topologically outside of the cell , because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol , you have to cross the cell membrane , just like if you were headed for the extracellular space in those cases , chloroplast targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway \)
after a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol , an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates , or adds a phosphate group to many \( but not all \) of them in their transit sequences phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide , keeping it from folding prematurely this is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place the cytosol at the same time , they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast these proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast
in land plants , chloroplasts are generally lens shaped , 5 8 m in diameter and 1 3 m thick greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae , which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net \( e g , oedogonium \) , a cup \( e g , chlamydomonas \) , a ribbon like spiral around the edges of the cell \( e g , spirogyra \) , or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges \( e g , sirogonium \) some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell they are star shaped in zygnema , or may follow the shape of half the cell in order desmidiales in some algae , the chloroplast takes up most of the cell , with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles \( for example some species of chlorella have a cup shaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell \)
there are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast membranes the fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria this is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host 's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium which is not true both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium 's original double membranes
the chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane this is not a valid comparison the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate atp energy the only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system even so , in terms of in out , the direction of chloroplast h ion flow is in the opposite direction compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria in addition , in terms of function , the inner chloroplast membrane , which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials , has no counterpart in the mitochondrion
the chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm , forming a stromule , or stroma containing tubule stromules are very rare in chloroplasts , and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots , respectively they may exist to increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross membrane transport , because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum when they were first observed in 1962 , some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual , claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts however , there is a growing body of evidence that stromules are functional , integral features of plant cell plastids , not merely artifacts
some chloroplasts contain a structure called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum it is often found in the chloroplasts of c4 plants , though it has also been found in some c3 angiosperms , and even some gymnosperms the chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm the small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space
chloroplasts have their own ribosomes , which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins chloroplast ribosomes are about two thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes \( around 17 nm vs 25 nm \) they take mrnas transcribed from the chloroplast dna and translate them into protein while similar to bacterial ribosomes , chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria , so chloroplast ribosomes include some chloroplast unique features small subunit ribosomal rnas in several chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts lack motifs for shine dalgarno sequence recognition , which is considered essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes such loss is also rarely observed in other plastids and prokaryotes
plastoglobuli \( singular plastoglobulus , sometimes spelled plastoglobule \( s \) \) , are spherical bubbles of lipids and proteins about 45 60 nanometers across they are surrounded by a lipid monolayer plastoglobuli are found in all chloroplasts , but become more common when the chloroplast is under oxidative stress , or when it ages and transitions into a gerontoplast plastoglobuli also exhibit a greater size variation under these conditions they are also common in etioplasts , but decrease in number as the etioplasts mature into chloroplasts
plastoglobuli were once thought to be free floating in the stroma , but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid , a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network in normal green chloroplasts , the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly , attached directly to their parent thylakoid in old or stressed chloroplasts , plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains , still always anchored to a thylakoid
the chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae contain structures called pyrenoids they are not found in higher plants pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which are a site of starch accumulation in plants that contain them they consist of a matrix opaque to electrons , surrounded by two hemispherical starch plates the starch is accumulated as the pyrenoids mature in algae with carbon concentrating mechanisms , the enzyme rubisco is found in the pyrenoids starch can also accumulate around the pyrenoids when co2 is scarce pyrenoids can divide to form new pyrenoids , or be produced de novo
in the helical thylakoid model , grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids , though grana with 10 20 thylakoids are most common wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids , also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids the helices ascend at an angle of 20 25 , connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge like slit junction the helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana , or narrow to tube like bridges between grana while different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins , the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth
embedded in the thylakoid membranes are important protein complexes which carry out the light reactions of photosynthesis photosystem ii and photosystem i contain light harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space , decreasing the ph and turning it acidic atp synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate atp energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma much like a dam turbine
there are two types of thylakoids granal thylakoids , which are arranged in grana , and stromal thylakoids , which are in contact with the stroma granal thylakoids are pancake shaped circular disks about 300 600 nanometers in diameter stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana the flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem ii protein complex this allows them to stack tightly , forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane , called granal membrane , increasing stability and surface area for light capture
in addition to chlorophylls , another group of yellow orange pigments called carotenoids are also found in the photosystems there are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids they help transfer and dissipate excess energy , and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green , like during the fall , when the leaves of some land plants change color carotene is a bright red orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts , like chlorophyll a xanthophylls , especially the orange red zeaxanthin , are also common many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts
phycobilins are a third group of pigments found in cyanobacteria , and glaucophyte , red algal , and cryptophyte chloroplasts phycobilins come in all colors , though phycoerytherin is one of the pigments that makes many red algae red phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called phycobilisomes like photosystem i and atp synthase , phycobilisomes jut into the stroma , preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria do n't have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes , and keep them in their thylakoid space instead
to fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules in the process of photosynthesis , chloroplasts use an enzyme called rubisco rubisco has a problem it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen , so at high oxygen concentrations , rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors this has the end result of atp energy being wasted and co2 being released , all with no sugar being produced this is a big problem , since o2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis , causing issues down the line in the calvin cycle which uses rubisco
as a result , chloroplasts in c4 mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells , chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions , so they lack rubisco , and have normal grana and thylakoids , which they use to make atp and nadph , as well as oxygen they store co2 in a four carbon compound , which is why the process is called c4 photosynthesis the four carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts , where it drops off co2 and returns to the mesophyll bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions , preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity because of this , they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow , a light driven method of synthesizing atp to power the calvin cycle without generating oxygen they lack photosystem ii , and only have photosystem i the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the calvin cycle and make sugar , they often contain large starch grains
not all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts all green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts the chloroplasts , or more specifically , the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green the plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells , though chloroplasts can also be found in collenchyma tissue a plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell a typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts
in some plants such as cacti , chloroplasts are found in the stems , though in most plants , chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves one square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts within a leaf , chloroplasts are mainly found in the mesophyll layers of a leaf , and the guard cells of stomata palisade mesophyll cells can contain 30 70 chloroplasts per cell , while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8 15 per cell , as well as much less chlorophyll chloroplasts can also be found in the bundle sheath cells of a leaf , especially in c4 plants , which carry out the calvin cycle in their bundle sheath cells they are often absent from the epidermis of a leaf
the chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light in low light conditions , they will spread out in a sheet maximizing the surface area to absorb light under intense light , they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell 's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge on this reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage this ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones chloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus response systems that can be found in plants mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move
plants have two main immune responses the hypersensitive response , in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death , and systemic acquired resistance , where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen 's presence chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system , producing reactive oxygen species high levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response the reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance , triggering defense molecule production in the rest of the plant
chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors after detecting stress in a cell , which might be due to a pathogen , chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense signals as cellular signals , reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules , so they probably do n't leave the chloroplast , but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule all these molecules initiate retrograde signaling signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus
one of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis , the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy , to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars water \( h2o \) and carbon dioxide \( co2 \) are used in photosynthesis , and sugar and oxygen \( o2 \) is made , using light energy photosynthesis is divided into two stages the light reactions , where water is split to produce oxygen , and the dark reactions , or calvin cycle , which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide the two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate \( atp \) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate \( nadp \)
like mitochondria , chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an h , or hydrogen ion gradient to generate atp energy the two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water , and release them down an electron transport chain the molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space , creating a concentration gradient , with more hydrogen ions \( up to a thousand times as many \) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient , flowing back out into the stroma through atp synthase atp synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate , or atp because chloroplast atp synthase projects out into the stroma , the atp is synthesized there , in position to be used in the dark reactions
while photosystem ii photolyzes water to obtain and energize new electrons , photosystem i simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain normally , the reenergized electrons are taken by nadp , though sometimes they can flow back down more h pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more atp this is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled cyclic photophosphorylation is common in c4 plants , which need more atp than nadph
the calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme rubisco to fix co2 into five carbon ribulose bisphosphate \( rubp \) molecules the result is unstable six carbon molecules that immediately break down into three carbon molecules called 3 phosphoglyceric acid , or 3 pga the atp and nadph made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3 pga into glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate , or g3p sugar molecules most of the g3p molecules are recycled back into rubp using energy from more atp , but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle the end product of the dark reactions
alternatively , glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch , which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast under conditions such as high atmospheric co2 concentrations , these starch grains may grow very large , distorting the grana and thylakoids the starch granules displace the thylakoids , but leave them intact waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts , possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast \( or more accurately , the plant cell \) this depletes a plant 's free phosphate supply , which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis while linked to low photosynthesis rates , the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis , and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis depressing factor
photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well , so it can accidentally add o2 instead of co2 to rubp this process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis it consumes atp and oxygen , releases co2 , and produces no sugar it can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the calvin cycle several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast , increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis these mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms , or ccms these include crassulacean acid metabolism , c4 carbon fixation , and pyrenoids chloroplasts in c4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism
chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell 's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur containing ones like cysteine and methionine cysteine is made in the chloroplast \( the proplastid too \) but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria , probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed the chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol
chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a plastid , though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably there are many other types of plastids , which carry out various functions all chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote , or fertilized egg proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant 's apical meristems chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems instead , the formation of starch storing amyloplasts is more common
if angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation , proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts an etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll , and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma , called a prolamellar body while etioplasts lack chlorophyll , they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked within a few minutes of light exposure , the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids , and chlorophyll starts to be produced this process , where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast , takes several hours gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts
plastid differentiation is not permanent , in fact many interconversions are possible chloroplasts may be converted to chromoplasts , which are pigment filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit starch storing amyloplasts can also be converted to chromoplasts , and it is possible for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts , like what happens when a carrot or a potato is illuminated if a plant is injured , or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state , chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids chloroplast , amyloplast , chromoplast , proplast , etc , are not absolute states intermediate forms are common
the division process starts when the proteins ftsz1 and ftsz2 assemble into filaments , and with the help of a protein arc6 , form a structure called a z ring within the chloroplast 's stroma the min system manages the placement of the z ring , ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly the protein mind prevents ftsz from linking up and forming filaments another protein arc3 may also be involved , but it is not very well understood these proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast , preventing z ring formation there , but near the center of the chloroplast , mine inhibits them , allowing the z ring to form
next , the two plastid dividing rings , or pd rings form the inner plastid dividing ring is located in the inner side of the chloroplast 's inner membrane , and is formed first the outer plastid dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane it consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across , arranged in rows 6 4 nanometers apart , and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast this is when chloroplast constriction begins in a few species like cyanidioschyzon merol , chloroplasts have a third plastid dividing ring located in the chloroplast 's intermembrane space
light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light , but are slow to complete division they require exposure to bright white light to complete division spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell shaped chloroplasts exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell shaped chloroplasts
recently , chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops since , in most flowering plants , chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent , transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen this makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained , thus posing significantly lower environmental risks this biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture while the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species , recent results in tobacco plants are promising , showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1 , 000 , 000
a prime number \( or a prime \) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number for example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering the uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e g , 3 , 1 3 , 1 1 3 , etc are all valid factorizations of 3
the property of being prime \( or not \) is called primality a simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division it consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers these include the miller rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small probability of error , and the aks primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms , such as mersenne numbers as of january 2016 update , the largest known prime number has 22 , 338 , 618 decimal digits
there are infinitely many primes , as demonstrated by euclid around 300 bc there is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers however , the distribution of primes , that is to say , the statistical behaviour of primes in the large , can be modelled the first result in that direction is the prime number theorem , proven at the end of the 19th century , which says that the probability that a given , randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits , or to the logarithm of n
many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , such as goldbach 's conjecture \( that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes \) , and the twin prime conjecture \( that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2 \) such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers primes are used in several routines in information technology , such as public key cryptography , which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains , mainly algebra , such as prime elements and prime ideals
hence , 6 is not prime the image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime 12 3 4 no even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition , any such number n has at least three distinct divisors , namely 1 , 2 , and n this implies that n is not prime accordingly , the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2 similarly , when written in the usual decimal system , all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5
most early greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number , so they could not consider it to be a prime by the middle ages and renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number in the mid 18th century christian goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with leonhard euler who did not agree in the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime for example , derrick norman lehmer 's list of primes up to 10 , 006 , 721 , reprinted as late as 1956 , started with 1 as its first prime henri lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime by the early 20th century , mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number , but rather forms its own special category as a unit
a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime , but euclid 's fundamental theorem of arithmetic \( mentioned above \) would not hold as stated for example , the number 15 can be factored as 3 5 and 1 3 5 if 1 were admitted as a prime , these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers , so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified similarly , the sieve of eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 \( that is , all other numbers \) and produce as output only the single number 1 furthermore , the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks , such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of euler 's totient function or the sum of divisors function
there are hints in the surviving records of the ancient egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers the egyptian fraction expansions in the rhind papyrus , for instance , have quite different forms for primes and for composites however , the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the ancient greeks euclid 's elements \( circa 300 bc \) contain important theorems about primes , including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a mersenne prime the sieve of eratosthenes , attributed to eratosthenes , is a simple method to compute primes , although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way
after the greeks , little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century in 1640 pierre de fermat stated \( without proof \) fermat 's little theorem \( later proved by leibniz and euler \) fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n 1 are prime \( they are called fermat numbers \) and he verified this up to n 4 \( or 216 1 \) however , the very next fermat number 232 1 is composite \( one of its prime factors is 641 \) , as euler discovered later , and in fact no further fermat numbers are known to be prime the french monk marin mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p 1 , with p a prime they are called mersenne primes in his honor
the most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division this routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n if the result of any of these divisions is an integer , then n is not a prime , otherwise it is a prime indeed , if is composite \( with a and b 1 \) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most for example , for , the trial divisions are by m 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 none of these numbers divides 37 , so 37 is prime this routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime for example , to check the primality of 37 , only three divisions are necessary \( m 2 , 3 , and 5 \) , given that 4 and 6 are composite
modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes , probabilistic \( or monte carlo \) and deterministic algorithms deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not for example , trial division is a deterministic algorithm because , if performed correctly , it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite probabilistic algorithms are normally faster , but do not completely prove that a number is prime these tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way for example , a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number , but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number if we repeat the test n times and pass every time , then the probability that our number is composite is 1 \( 1 p \) n , which decreases exponentially with the number of tests , so we can be as sure as we like \( though never perfectly sure \) that the number is prime on the other hand , if the test ever fails , then we know that the number is composite
a particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the fermat primality test , which relies on the fact \( fermat 's little theorem \) that np n \( mod p \) for any n if p is a prime number if we have a number b that we want to test for primality , then we work out nb \( mod b \) for a random value of n as our test a flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers \( the carmichael numbers \) that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not prime , so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael numbers carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers , though , so this test can be useful for practical purposes more powerful extensions of the fermat primality test , such as the baillie psw , miller rabin , and solovay strassen tests , are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number
are prime prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes other primes where either p 1 or p 1 is of a particular shape include the sophie germain primes \( primes of the form 2p 1 with p prime \) , primorial primes , fermat primes and mersenne primes , that is , prime numbers that are of the form 2p 1 , where p is an arbitrary prime the lucas lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form this is why the largest known prime has almost always been a mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers
the following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types some of these primes have been found using distributed computing in 2009 , the great internet mersenne prime search project was awarded a us 100 , 000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits the electronic frontier foundation also offers 150 , 000 and 250 , 000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits , respectively some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form \( that is , no simple formula such as that of mersenne primes \) have been found by taking a piece of semi random binary data , converting it to a number n , multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k , and searching for possible primes within the interval 256kn 1 , 256k \( n 1 \) 1 citation needed
are prime for any natural number n here represents the floor function , i e , largest integer not greater than the number in question the latter formula can be shown using bertrand 's postulate \( proven first by chebyshev \) , which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n p 2n 2 , for any natural number n 3 however , computing a or requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with another formula is based on wilson 's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once
can have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime , i e , their greatest common divisor is one if this necessary condition is satisfied , dirichlet 's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes the picture below illustrates this with q 9 the numbers are wrapped around as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed primes are highlighted in red the rows \( progressions \) starting with a 3 , 6 , or 9 contain at most one prime number in all other rows \( a 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8 \) there are infinitely many prime numbers what is more , the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1 6
the zeta function is closely related to prime numbers for example , the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function if there were only finitely many primes then \( 1 \) would have a finite value however , the harmonic series 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 diverges \( i e , exceeds any given number \) , so there must be infinitely many primes another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity \( basel problem \) , due to euler ,
the unproven riemann hypothesis , dating from 1859 , states that except for s 2 , 4 , , all zeroes of the function have real part equal to 1 2 the connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible clarification needed from a physical viewpoint , it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise from a mathematical viewpoint , it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes \( about x log x of numbers less than x are primes , the prime number theorem \) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x \( for intervals near x \) this hypothesis is generally believed to be correct in particular , the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason
in addition to the riemann hypothesis , many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed often having an elementary formulation , many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades all four of landau 's problems from 1912 are still unsolved one of them is goldbach 's conjecture , which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes as of february 2011 update , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n 2 1017 weaker statements than this have been proven , for example vinogradov 's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes chen 's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime , the product of two primes also , any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes the branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory
a third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes it is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes , pairs of primes with difference 2 \( twin prime conjecture \) polignac 's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture , it states that for every positive integer n , there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n it is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 1 these conjectures are special cases of the broad schinzel 's hypothesis h brocard 's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2 legendre 's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and \( n 1 \) 2 for every positive integer n it is implied by the stronger cram r 's conjecture
for a long time , number theory in general , and the study of prime numbers in particular , was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics , with no applications outside of the self interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly in particular , number theorists such as british mathematician g h hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance however , this vision was shattered in the 1970s , when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators
giuga 's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime another consequence of fermat 's little theorem is the following if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5 , 1 p is always a recurring decimal , whose period is p 1 or a divisor of p 1 the fraction 1 p expressed likewise in base q \( rather than base 10 \) has similar effect , provided that p is not a prime factor of q wilson 's theorem says that an integer p 1 is prime if and only if the factorial \( p 1 \) ! 1 is divisible by p moreover , an integer n 4 is composite if and only if \( n 1 \) ! is divisible by n
several public key cryptography algorithms , such as rsa and the diffie hellman key exchange , are based on large prime numbers \( for example , 512 bit primes are frequently used for rsa and 1024 bit primes are typical for diffie hellman \) rsa relies on the assumption that it is much easier \( i e , more efficient \) to perform the multiplication of two \( large \) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y \( assumed coprime \) if only the product xy is known the diffie hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation , while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem
the evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus magicicada make use of prime numbers these insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground they only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7 , 13 or 17 years , at which point they fly about , breed , and then die after a few weeks at most the logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on magicicadas if magicicadas appeared at a non prime number intervals , say every 12 years , then predators appearing every 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , or 12 years would be sure to meet them over a 200 year period , average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14 and 15 year cicadas would be up to 2 higher than during outbreaks of 13 and 17 year cicadas though small , this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime numbered life cycle for these insects
the concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics generally , prime indicates minimality or indecomposability , in an appropriate sense for example , the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field f containing both 0 and 1 it is either q or the finite field with p elements , whence the name often a second , additional meaning is intended by using the word prime , namely that any object can be , essentially uniquely , decomposed into its prime components for example , in knot theory , a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots prime models and prime 3 manifolds are other examples of this type
prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring r , an algebraic structure where addition , subtraction and multiplication are defined prime elements and irreducible elements an element p of r is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit \( i e , does not have a multiplicative inverse \) and satisfies the following requirement given x and y in r such that p divides the product xy , then p divides x or y an element is irreducible if it is not a unit and cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units in the ring z of integers , the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements , which is
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains an example of such a domain is the gaussian integers z i , that is , the set of complex numbers of the form a bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers its prime elements are known as gaussian primes not every prime \( in z \) is a gaussian prime in the bigger ring z i , 2 factors into the product of the two gaussian primes \( 1 i \) and \( 1 i \) rational primes \( i e prime elements in z \) of the form 4k 3 are gaussian primes , whereas rational primes of the form 4k 1 are not
in ring theory , the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal prime ideals , which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal , are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra , algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry the prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals \( 0 \) , \( 2 \) , \( 3 \) , \( 5 \) , \( 7 \) , \( 11 \) , the fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the lasker noether theorem , which expresses every ideal in a noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals , which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers
prime ideals are the points of algebro geometric objects , via the notion of the spectrum of a ring arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion , and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory for example , factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field , a basic problem of algebraic number theory , bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry such ramification questions occur even in number theoretic questions solely concerned with integers for example , prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity , a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations
in particular , this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p , in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value \( also referred to as the infinite prime \) while completing q \( roughly , filling the gaps \) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers , completing with respect to the p adic norm p yields the field of p adic numbers these are essentially all possible ways to complete q , by ostrowski 's theorem certain arithmetic questions related to q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed \( or local \) fields this local global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory
prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers the french composer olivier messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through natural phenomena in works such as la nativit du seigneur \( 1935 \) and quatre tudes de rythme \( 1949 50 \) , he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms the primes 41 , 43 , 47 and 53 appear in the third tude , neumes rythmiques according to messiaen this way of composing was inspired by the movements of nature , movements of free and unequal durations
the rhine \( romansh rein , german rhein , french le rhin , dutch rijn \) is a european river that begins in the swiss canton of graub nden in the southeastern swiss alps , forms part of the swiss austrian , swiss liechtenstein border , swiss german and then the franco german border , then flows through the rhineland and eventually empties into the north sea in the netherlands the biggest city on the river rhine is cologne , germany with a population of more than 1 , 050 , 000 people it is the second longest river in central and western europe \( after the danube \) , at about 1 , 230 km \( 760 mi \) , note 2 note 1 with an average discharge of about 2 , 900 m3 s \( 100 , 000 cu ft s \)
the variant forms of the name of the rhine in modern languages are all derived from the gaulish name r nos , which was adapted in roman era geography \( 1st century bc \) as greek \( rh nos \) , latin rhenus note 3 the spelling with rh in english rhine as well as in german rhein and french rhin is due to the influence of greek orthography , while the vocalisation i is due to the proto germanic adoption of the gaulish name as r naz , via old frankish giving old english r n , old high german r n , dutch rijn \( formerly also spelled rhijn \) \) the diphthong in modern german rhein \( also adopted in romansh rein , rain \) is a central german development of the early modern period , the alemannic name r \( n \) retaining the older vocalism , note 4 as does ripuarian rhing , while palatine has diphthongized rhei , rhoi spanish is with french in adopting the germanic vocalism rin , while italian , occitan and portuguese retain the latin ren
the length of the rhine is conventionally measured in rhine kilometers \( rheinkilometer \) , a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the old rhine bridge at constance \( 0 km \) to hoek van holland \( 1036 20 km \) the river length is significantly shortened from the river 's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century note 7 the total length of the rhine , to the inclusion of lake constance and the alpine rhine is more difficult to measure objectively it was cited as 1 , 232 kilometres \( 766 miles \) by the dutch rijkswaterstaat in 2010 note 1
near tamins reichenau the anterior rhine and the posterior rhine join and form the rhine the river makes a distinctive turn to the north near chur this section is nearly 86 km long , and descends from a height of 599 m to 396 m it flows through a wide glacial alpine valley known as the rhine valley \( german rheintal \) near sargans a natural dam , only a few metres high , prevents it from flowing into the open seeztal valley and then through lake walen and lake zurich into the river aare the alpine rhine begins in the most western part of the swiss canton of graub nden , and later forms the border between switzerland to the west and liechtenstein and later austria to the east
the mouth of the rhine into lake constance forms an inland delta the delta is delimited in the west by the alter rhein \( old rhine \) and in the east by a modern canalized section most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary it includes the austrian towns of gai au , h chst and fu ach the natural rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments in the local alemannic dialect , the singular is pronounced isel and this is also the local pronunciation of esel \( donkey \) many local fields have an official name containing this element
a regulation of the rhine was called for , with an upper canal near diepoldsau and a lower canal at fu ach , in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western rhine delta the dornbirner ach had to be diverted , too , and it now flows parallel to the canalized rhine into the lake its water has a darker color than the rhine the latter 's lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains it is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake this has already happened to the former lake tuggenersee
lake constance consists of three bodies of water the obersee \( upper lake \) , the untersee \( lower lake \) , and a connecting stretch of the rhine , called the seerhein \( lake rhine \) the lake is situated in germany , switzerland and austria near the alps specifically , its shorelines lie in the german states of bavaria and baden w rttemberg , the austrian state of vorarlberg , and the swiss cantons of thurgau and st gallen the rhine flows into it from the south following the swiss austrian border it is located at approximately 47 39 n 9 19 e 47 650 n 9 317 e 47 650 9 317
the flow of cold , gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake the cold water flows near the surface and at first does n't mix with the warmer , green waters of upper lake but then , at the so called rheinbrech , the rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water the flow reappears on the surface at the northern \( german \) shore of the lake , off the island of lindau the water then follows the northern shore until hagnau am bodensee a small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of mainau into lake berlingen most of the water flows via the constance hopper into the rheinrinne \( rhine gutter \) and seerhein depending on the water level , this flow of the rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake
the rhine emerges from lake constance , flows generally westward , as the hochrhein , passes the rhine falls , and is joined by its major tributary , the river aare the aare more than doubles the rhine 's water discharge , to an average of nearly 1 , 000 m3 s \( 35 , 000 cu ft s \) , and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the dutch border the aare also contains the waters from the 4 , 274 m \( 14 , 022 ft \) summit of finsteraarhorn , the highest point of the rhine basin the rhine roughly forms the german swiss border from lake constance with the exceptions of the canton of schaffhausen and parts of the cantons of z rich and basel stadt , until it turns north at the so called rhine knee at basel , leaving switzerland
in the centre of basel , the first major city in the course of the stream , is located the rhine knee this is a major bend , where the overall direction of the rhine changes from west to north here the high rhine ends legally , the central bridge is the boundary between high and upper rhine the river now flows north as upper rhine through the upper rhine plain , which is about 300 km long and up to 40 km wide the most important tributaries in this area are the ill below of strasbourg , the neckar in mannheim and the main across from mainz in mainz , the rhine leaves the upper rhine valley and flows through the mainz basin
the upper rhine region was changed significantly by a rhine straightening program in the 19th century the rate of flow was increased and the ground water level fell significantly dead branches dried up and the amount of forests on the flood plains decreased sharply on the french side , the grand canal d'alsace was dug , which carries a significant part of the river water , and all of the traffic in some places , there are large compensation pools , for example the huge bassin de compensation de plobsheim in alsace
the rhine is the longest river in germany it is here that the rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries , such as the neckar , the main and , later , the moselle , which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3 s \( 11 , 000 cu ft s \) northeastern france drains to the rhine via the moselle smaller rivers drain the vosges and jura mountains uplands most of luxembourg and a very small part of belgium also drain to the rhine via the moselle as it approaches the dutch border , the rhine has an annual mean discharge of 2 , 290 m3 s \( 81 , 000 cu ft s \) and an average width of 400 m \( 1 , 300 ft \)
between bingen and bonn , the middle rhine flows through the rhine gorge , a formation which was created by erosion the rate of erosion equaled the uplift in the region , such that the river was left at about its original level while the surrounding lands raised the gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river which is known for its many castles and vineyards it is a unesco world heritage site \( 2002 \) and known as the romantic rhine , with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the middle ages and many quaint and lovely country villages
until the early 1980s , industry was a major source of water pollution although many plants and factories can be found along the rhine up into switzerland , it is along the lower rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated , as the river passes the major cities of cologne , d sseldorf and duisburg duisburg is the home of europe 's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of rotterdam , antwerp and amsterdam the ruhr , which joins the rhine in duisburg , is nowadays a clean river , thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls , a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures , such as the reforestation of slag and brownfields the ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water it contributes 70 m3 s \( 2 , 500 cu ft s \) to the rhine other rivers in the ruhr area , above all , the emscher , still carry a considerable degree of pollution
the dominant economic sectors in the middle rhine area are viniculture and tourism the rhine gorge between r desheim am rhein and koblenz is listed as a unesco world heritage site near sankt goarshausen , the rhine flows around the famous rock lorelei with its outstanding architectural monuments , the slopes full of vines , settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes , the middle rhine valley can be considered the epitome of the rhine romanticism
the lower rhine flows through north rhine westphalia its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized , in particular the agglomerations cologne , d sseldorf and ruhr area here the rhine flows through the largest conurbation in germany , the rhine ruhr region one of the most important cities in this region is duisburg with the largest river port in europe \( duisport \) the region downstream of duisburg is more agricultural in wesel , 30 km downstream of duisburg , is located the western end of the second east west shipping route , the wesel datteln canal , which runs parallel to the lippe between emmerich and cleves the emmerich rhine bridge , the longest suspension bridge in germany , crosses the 400 m wide river near krefeld , the river crosses the uerdingen line , the line which separates the areas where low german and high german are spoken
from here , the situation becomes more complicated , as the dutch name rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water two thirds of the water flow volume of the rhine flows farther west , through the waal and then , via the merwede and nieuwe merwede \( de biesbosch \) , merging with the meuse , through the hollands diep and haringvliet estuaries , into the north sea the beneden merwede branches off , near hardinxveld giessendam and continues as the noord , to join the lek , near the village of kinderdijk , to form the nieuwe maas then flows past rotterdam and continues via het scheur and the nieuwe waterweg , to the north sea the oude maas branches off , near dordrecht , farther down rejoining the nieuwe maas to form het scheur
the other third of the water flows through the pannerdens kanaal and redistributes in the ijssel and nederrijn the ijssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the rhine north into the ijsselmeer \( a former bay \) , while the nederrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the waal however , at wijk bij duurstede , the nederrijn changes its name and becomes the lek it flows farther west , to rejoin the noord river into the nieuwe maas and to the north sea
the name rijn , from here on , is used only for smaller streams farther to the north , which together formed the main river rhine in roman times though they retained the name , these streams no longer carry water from the rhine , but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders from wijk bij duurstede , the old north branch of the rhine is called kromme rijn \( bent rhine \) past utrecht , first leidse rijn \( rhine of leiden \) and then , oude rijn \( old rhine \) the latter flows west into a sluice at katwijk , where its waters can be discharged into the north sea this branch once formed the line along which the limes germanicus were built during periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages , the rhine took a left turn , creating the channel river , the course of which now lies below the english channel
the rhine meuse delta , the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn , close to the dutch german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn since the rhine contributes most of the water , the shorter term rhine delta is commonly used however , this name is also used for the river delta where the rhine flows into lake constance , so it is clearer to call the larger one rhine meuse delta , or even rhine meuse scheldt delta , as the scheldt ends in the same delta
the shape of the rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations first , at millingen aan de rijn , the rhine splits into waal and pannerdens kanaal , which changes its name to nederrijn at angeren , and second near arnhem , the ijssel branches off from the nederrijn this creates three main flows , two of which change names rather often the largest and southern main branch begins as waal and continues as boven merwede \( upper merwede \) , beneden merwede \( lower merwede \) , noord river \( north river \) , nieuwe maas \( new meuse \) , het scheur \( the rip \) and nieuwe waterweg \( new waterway \) the middle flow begins as nederrijn , then changes into lek , then joins the noord , thereby forming nieuwe maas the northern flow keeps the name ijssel until it flows into lake ijsselmeer three more flows carry significant amounts of water the nieuwe merwede \( new merwede \) , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from boven to beneden merwede the oude maas \( old meuse \) , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from beneden merwede into noord , and dordtse kil , which branches off from oude maas
before the st elizabeth 's flood \( 1421 \) , the meuse flowed just south of today 's line merwede oude maas to the north sea and formed an archipelago like estuary with waal and lek this system of numerous bays , estuary like extended rivers , many islands and constant changes of the coastline , is hard to imagine today from 1421 to 1904 , the meuse and waal merged further upstream at gorinchem to form merwede for flood protection reasons , the meuse was separated from the waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called bergse maas , then amer and then flows into the former bay hollands diep
the hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta 's main arms , disconnected arms \( hollandse ijssel , linge , vecht , etc \) and smaller rivers and streams many rivers have been closed \( dammed \) and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders the construction of delta works changed the delta in the second half of the 20th century fundamentally currently rhine water runs into the sea , or into former marine bays now separated from the sea , in five places , namely at the mouths of the nieuwe merwede , nieuwe waterway \( nieuwe maas \) , dordtse kil , spui and ijssel
the rhine meuse delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents this meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea before the construction of the delta works , tidal influence was palpable up to nijmegen , and even today , after the regulatory action of the delta works , the tide acts far inland at the waal , for example , the most landward tidal influence can be detected between brakel and zaltbommel
in southern europe , the stage was set in the triassic period of the mesozoic era , with the opening of the tethys ocean , between the eurasian and african tectonic plates , between about 240 mbp and 220 mbp \( million years before present \) the present mediterranean sea descends from this somewhat larger tethys sea at about 180 mbp , in the jurassic period , the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the tethys floor , causing it to be subducted under eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the alpine orogeny of the oligocene and miocene periods several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of mediterranean geography iberia pushed up the pyrenees italy , the alps , and anatolia , moving west , the mountains of greece and the islands the compression and orogeny continue today , as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes
from the eocene onwards , the ongoing alpine orogeny caused a n s rift system to develop in this zone the main elements of this rift are the upper rhine graben , in southwest germany and eastern france and the lower rhine embayment , in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands by the time of the miocene , a river system had developed in the upper rhine graben , that continued northward and is considered the first rhine river at that time , it did not yet carry discharge from the alps instead , the watersheds of the rhone and danube drained the northern flanks of the alps
through stream capture , the rhine extended its watershed southward by the pliocene period , the rhine had captured streams down to the vosges mountains , including the mosel , the main and the neckar the northern alps were then drained by the rhone by the early pleistocene period , the rhine had captured most of its current alpine watershed from the rh ne , including the aar since that time , the rhine has added the watershed above lake constance \( vorderrhein , hinterrhein , alpenrhein captured from the rh ne \) , the upper reaches of the main , beyond schweinfurt and the vosges mountains , captured from the meuse , to its watershed
around 2 5 million years ago \( ending 11 , 600 years ago \) was the geological period of the ice ages since approximately 600 , 000 years ago , six major ice ages have occurred , in which sea level dropped 120 m \( 390 ft \) and much of the continental margins became exposed in the early pleistocene , the rhine followed a course to the northwest , through the present north sea during the so called anglian glaciation \( 450 , 000 yr bp , marine oxygen isotope stage 12 \) , the northern part of the present north sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed , that overflowed through the english channel this caused the rhine 's course to be diverted through the english channel since then , during glacial times , the river mouth was located offshore of brest , france and rivers , like the thames and the seine , became tributaries to the rhine during interglacials , when sea level rose to approximately the present level , the rhine built deltas , in what is now the netherlands
the last glacial ran from 74 , 000 \( bp before present \) , until the end of the pleistocene \( 11 , 600 bp \) in northwest europe , it saw two very cold phases , peaking around 70 , 000 bp and around 29 , 000 24 , 000 bp the last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum \( last glacial maximum \) during this time , the lower rhine flowed roughly west through the netherlands and extended to the southwest , through the english channel and finally , to the atlantic ocean the english channel , the irish channel and most of the north sea were dry land , mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m \( 390 ft \) lower than today
most of the rhine 's current course was not under the ice during the last ice age although , its source must still have been a glacier a tundra , with ice age flora and fauna , stretched across middle europe , from asia to the atlantic ocean such was the case during the last glacial maximum , ca 22 , 000 14 , 000 yr bp , when ice sheets covered scandinavia , the baltics , scotland and the alps , but left the space between as open tundra the loess or wind blown dust over that tundra , settled in and around the rhine valley , contributing to its current agricultural usefulness
as northwest europe slowly began to warm up from 22 , 000 years ago onward , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall winter snow covers melted in spring much of the discharge was routed to the rhine and its downstream extension rapid warming and changes of vegetation , to open forest , began about 13 , 000 bp by 9000 bp , europe was fully forested with globally shrinking ice cover , ocean water levels rose and the english channel and north sea re inundated meltwater , adding to the ocean and land subsidence , drowned the former coasts of europe transgressionally
since 7500 yr ago , a situation with tides and currents , very similar to present has existed rates of sea level rise had dropped so far , that natural sedimentation by the rhine and coastal processes together , could compensate the transgression by the sea in the last 7000 years , the coast line was roughly at the same location in the southern north sea , due to ongoing tectonic subsidence , the sea level is still rising , at the rate of about 1 3 cm \( 0 39 1 18 in \) per century \( 1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years \)
at the begin of the holocene \( 11 , 700 years ago \) , the rhine occupied its late glacial valley as a meandering river , it reworked its ice age braidplain as sea level continued to rise in the netherlands , the formation of the holocene rhine meuse delta began \( 8 , 000 years ago \) coeval absolute sea level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the peel boundary fault , the substrate and geomorphology , as inherited from the last glacial and the coastal marine dynamics , such as barrier and tidal inlet formations
since 3000 yr bp \( years before present \) , human impact is seen in the delta as a result of increasing land clearance \( bronze age agriculture \) , in the upland areas \( central germany \) , the sediment load of the rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up this caused increased flooding and sedimentation , ending peat formation in the delta the shifting of river channels to new locations , on the floodplain \( termed avulsion \) , was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta over the past 6000 years , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining , for salt and fuel , from roman times onward this was followed by embankment , of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries , which took place in the 11 13th century ad thereafter , canals were dug , bends were short cut and groynes were built , to prevent the river 's channels from migrating or silting up
at present , the branches waal and nederrijn lek discharge to the north sea , through the former meuse estuary , near rotterdam the river ijssel branch flows to the north and enters the ijsselmeer , formerly the zuider zee brackish lagoon however , since 1932 , a freshwater lake the discharge of the rhine is divided among three branches the river waal \( 6 9 of total discharge \) , the river nederrijn lek \( 2 9 of total discharge \) and the river ijssel \( 1 9 of total discharge \) this discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709 , by river engineering works , including the digging of the pannerdens canal and since the 20th century , with the help of weirs in the nederrijn river
the rhine was not known to herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century bc in roman era geography at that time , it formed the boundary between gaul and germania the upper rhine had been part of the areal of the late hallstatt culture since the 6th century bc , and by the 1st century bc , the areal of the la t ne culture covered almost its entire length , forming a contact zone with the jastorf culture , i e the locus of early celtic germanic cultural contact in roman geography , the rhine formed the boundary between gallia and germania by definition e g maurus servius honoratus , commentary on the aeneid of vergil \( 8 727 \) \( rhenus \) fluvius galliae , qui germanos a gallia dividit \( the rhine is a \) river of gaul , which divides the germanic people from gaul
from the death of augustus in ad 14 until after ad 70 , rome accepted as her germanic frontier the water boundary of the rhine and upper danube beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of frankfurt , opposite the roman border fortress of moguntiacum \( mainz \) , the southernmost slopes of the black forest and a few scattered bridge heads the northern section of this frontier , where the rhine is deep and broad , remained the roman boundary until the empire fell the southern part was different the upper rhine and upper danube are easily crossed the frontier which they form is inconveniently long , enclosing an acute angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern baden and w rttemberg the germanic populations of these lands seem in roman times to have been scanty , and roman subjects from the modern alsace lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards
the romans kept eight legions in five bases along the rhine the actual number of legions present at any base or in all , depended on whether a state or threat of war existed between about ad 14 and 180 , the assignment of legions was as follows for the army of germania inferior , two legions at vetera \( xanten \) , i germanica and xx valeria \( pannonian troops \) two legions at oppidum ubiorum \( town of the ubii \) , which was renamed to colonia agrippina , descending to cologne , v alaudae , a celtic legion recruited from gallia narbonensis and xxi , possibly a galatian legion from the other side of the empire
germanic tribes crossed the rhine in the migration period , by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of francia on the lower rhine , burgundy on the upper rhine and alemannia on the high rhine this germanic heroic age is reflected in medieval legend , such as the nibelungenlied which tells of the hero siegfried killing a dragon on the drachenfels \( siebengebirge \) \( dragons rock \) , near bonn at the rhine and of the burgundians and their court at worms , at the rhine and kriemhild 's golden treasure , which was thrown into the rhine by hagen
by the 6th century , the rhine was within the borders of francia in the 9th , it formed part of the border between middle and western francia , but in the 10th century , it was fully within the holy roman empire , flowing through swabia , franconia and lower lorraine the mouths of the rhine , in the county of holland , fell to the burgundian netherlands in the 15th century holland remained contentious territory throughout the european wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the holy roman empire , when the length of the rhine fell to the first french empire and its client states the alsace on the left banks of the upper rhine was sold to burgundy by archduke sigismund of austria in 1469 and eventually fell to france in the thirty years' war the numerous historic castles in rhineland palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route
since the peace of westphalia , the upper rhine formed a contentious border between france and germany establishing natural borders on the rhine was a long term goal of french foreign policy , since the middle ages , though the language border was and is far more to the west french leaders , such as louis xiv and napoleon bonaparte , tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the rhine the confederation of the rhine was established by napoleon , as a french client state , in 1806 and lasted until 1814 , during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the first french empire in 1840 , the rhine crisis , prompted by french prime minister adolphe thiers 's desire to reinstate the rhine as a natural border , led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in germany
at the end of world war i , the rhineland was subject to the treaty of versailles this decreed that it would be occupied by the allies , until 1935 and after that , it would be a demilitarised zone , with the german army forbidden to enter the treaty of versailles and this particular provision , in general , caused much resentment in germany and is often cited as helping adolf hitler 's rise to power the allies left the rhineland , in 1930 and the german army re occupied it in 1936 , which was enormously popular in germany although the allies could probably have prevented the re occupation , britain and france were not inclined to do so , a feature of their policy of appeasement to hitler
in world war ii , it was recognised that the rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of germany , by the western allies the rhine bridge at arnhem , immortalized in the book , a bridge too far and the film , was a central focus of the battle for arnhem , during the failed operation market garden of september 1944 the bridges at nijmegen , over the waal distributary of the rhine , were also an objective of operation market garden in a separate operation , the ludendorff bridge , crossing the rhine at remagen , became famous , when u s forces were able to capture it intact much to their own surprise after the germans failed to demolish it this also became the subject of a film , the bridge at remagen seven days to the river rhine was a warsaw pact war plan for an invasion of western europe during the cold war
until 1932 the generally accepted length of the rhine was 1 , 230 kilometres \( 764 miles \) in 1932 the german encyclopedia knaurs lexikon stated the length as 1 , 320 kilometres \( 820 miles \) , presumably a typographical error after this number was placed into the authoritative brockhaus enzyklop die , it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications the error was discovered in 2010 , and the dutch rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at 1 , 232 kilometres \( 766 miles \) note 1
following a referendum in 1997 , in which the scottish electorate voted for devolution , the current parliament was convened by the scotland act 1998 , which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature the act delineates the legislative competence of the parliament the areas in which it can make laws by explicitly specifying powers that are reserved to the parliament of the united kingdom the scottish parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to westminster the british parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the scottish parliament , and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws the first meeting of the new parliament took place on 12 may 1999
for the next three hundred years , scotland was directly governed by the parliament of great britain and the subsequent parliament of the united kingdom , both seated at westminster , and the lack of a parliament of scotland remained an important element in scottish national identity suggestions for a 'devolved' parliament were made before 1914 , but were shelved due to the outbreak of the first world war a sharp rise in nationalism in scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence , and in 1969 prompted the incumbent labour government of harold wilson to set up the kilbrandon commission to consider the british constitution one of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self government for scotland , within the unitary state of the united kingdom kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected scottish assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic scottish affairs
during this time , the discovery of oil in the north sea and the following it 's scotland 's oil campaign of the scottish national party \( snp \) resulted in rising support for scottish independence , as well as the snp the party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting scotland as much as they should the combined effect of these events led to prime minister wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974 however , it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a scottish assembly were passed by the united kingdom parliament
under the terms of the scotland act 1978 , an elected assembly would be set up in edinburgh provided that the majority of the scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 march 1979 that represented at least 40 of the total electorate the 1979 scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved scottish assembly failed although the vote was 51 6 in favour of a scottish assembly , this figure did not equal the 40 of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure , as 32 9 of the eligible voting population did not , or had been unable to , vote
throughout the 1980s and 1990s , demand for a scottish parliament grew , in part because the government of the united kingdom was controlled by the conservative party , while scotland itself elected relatively few conservative mps in the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat , the campaign for a scottish assembly was initiated as a pressure group , leading to the 1989 scottish constitutional convention with various organisations such as scottish churches , political parties and representatives of industry taking part publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995 , the convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the parliament
since september 2004 , the official home of the scottish parliament has been a new scottish parliament building , in the holyrood area of edinburgh the scottish parliament building was designed by spanish architect enric miralles in partnership with local edinburgh architecture firm rmjm which was led by design principal tony kettle some of the principal features of the complex include leaf shaped buildings , a grass roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings throughout the building there are many repeated motifs , such as shapes based on raeburn 's skating minister crow stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the garden lobby , complete the unique architecture queen elizabeth ii opened the new building on 9 october 2004
whilst the permanent building at holyrood was being constructed , the parliament 's temporary home was the general assembly hall of the church of scotland on the royal mile in edinburgh official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the assembly hall , which is part of the school of divinity of the university of edinburgh this building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the church 's general assembly in may 2000 , the parliament was temporarily relocated to the former strathclyde regional council debating chamber in glasgow , and to the university of aberdeen in may 2002
in addition to the general assembly hall , the parliament also used buildings rented from the city of edinburgh council the former administrative building of lothian regional council on george iv bridge was used for the msp 's offices following the move to holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished the former midlothian county buildings facing parliament square , high street and george iv bridge in edinburgh \( originally built as the headquarters of the pre 1975 midlothian county council \) housed the parliament 's visitors' centre and shop , whilst the main hall was used as the parliament 's principal committee room
after each election to the scottish parliament , at the beginning of each parliamentary session , parliament elects one msp to serve as presiding officer , the equivalent of the speaker \( currently tricia marwick \) , and two msps to serve as deputies \( currently elaine smith and john scott \) the presiding officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 msps , which is the only secret ballot conducted in the scottish parliament principally , the role of the presiding officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the scottish parliamentary corporate body when chairing meetings of the parliament , the presiding officer and his her deputies must be politically impartial during debates , the presiding officer \( or the deputy \) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks , who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings a vote clerk sits in front of the presiding officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks
as a member of the scottish parliamentary corporate body , the presiding officer is responsible for ensuring that the parliament functions effectively and has the staff , property and resources it requires to operate convening the parliamentary bureau , which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber , is another of the roles of the presiding officer under the standing orders of the parliament the bureau consists of the presiding officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the parliament amongst the duties of the bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber , establish the number , remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation \( bills \) through the parliament the presiding officer also represents the scottish parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity
the debating chamber of the scottish parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle , which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members there are 131 seats in the debating chamber of the total 131 seats , 129 are occupied by the parliament 's elected msps and 2 are seats for the scottish law officers the lord advocate and the solicitor general for scotland , who are not elected members of the parliament but are members of the scottish government as such the law officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the parliament but , as they are not elected msps , cannot vote members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber , but typically sit in their party groupings the first minister , scottish cabinet ministers and law officers sit in the front row , in the middle section of the chamber the largest party in the parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle , with opposing parties on either side the presiding officer , parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber
in front of the presiding officers' desk is the parliamentary mace , which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from scottish rivers and inscribed with the words wisdom , compassion , justice and integrity the words there shall be a scottish parliament , which are the first words of the scotland act , are inscribed around the head of the mace , which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of parliament , reinforcing the authority of the parliament in its ability to make laws presented to the scottish parliament by the queen upon its official opening in july 1999 , the mace is displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid at the beginning of each sitting in the chamber , the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass , to symbolise that a full meeting of the parliament is taking place
parliament typically sits tuesdays , wednesdays and thursdays from early january to late june and from early september to mid december , with two week recesses in april and october plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on thursdays from 9 15 am to 6 pm chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public entry is free , but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space meetings are broadcast on the parliament 's own channel holyrood tv and on the bbc 's parliamentary channel bbc parliament proceedings are also recorded in text form , in print and online , in the official report , which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates
the first item of business on wednesdays is usually time for reflection , at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith this contrasts with the formal style of prayers , which is the first item of business in meetings of the house of commons speakers are drawn from across scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the scottish census invitations to address parliament in this manner are determined by the presiding officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau faith groups can make direct representations to the presiding officer to nominate speakers
the presiding officer \( or deputy presiding officer \) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak normally , the presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak typically , ministers or party leaders open debates , with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time the presiding officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems members may call each other directly by name , rather than by constituency or cabinet position , and hand clapping is allowed speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in english , but members may use scots , gaelic , or any other language with the agreement of the presiding officer the scottish parliament has conducted debates in the gaelic language
each sitting day , normally at 5 pm , msps decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day this decision time is heralded by the sounding of the division bell , which is heard throughout the parliamentary campus and alerts msps who are not in the chamber to return and vote at decision time , the presiding officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking are we all agreed \? , to which the chamber first votes orally if there is audible dissent , the presiding officer announces there will be a division and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks each msp has a unique access card with a microchip which , when inserted into the console , identifies them and allows them to vote as a result , the outcome of each division is known in seconds
the outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote parties entrust some msps , known as whips , with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line msps do not tend to vote against such instructions , since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections , and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright thus , as with many parliaments , the independence of members of the scottish parliament tends to be low , and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party 's policies are rare in some circumstances , however , parties announce free votes , which allows members to vote as they please this is typically done on moral issues
immediately after decision time a members debate is held , which lasts for 45 minutes members business is a debate on a motion proposed by an msp who is not a scottish minister such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member 's own constituency , an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time as well as the proposer , other members normally contribute to the debate the relevant minister , whose department the debate and motion relate to winds up the debate by speaking after all other participants
much of the work of the scottish parliament is done in committee the role of committees is stronger in the scottish parliament than in other parliamentary systems , partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber the principal role of committees in the scottish parliament is to take evidence from witnesses , conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation committee meetings take place on tuesday , wednesday and thursday morning when parliament is sitting committees can also meet at other locations throughout scotland
committees comprise a small number of msps , with membership reflecting the balance of parties across parliament there are different committees with their functions set out in different ways mandatory committees are committees which are set down under the scottish parliament 's standing orders , which govern their remits and proceedings the current mandatory committees in the fourth session of the scottish parliament are public audit equal opportunities european and external relations finance public petitions standards , procedures and public appointments and delegated powers and law reform
subject committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session , and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across parliament typically each committee corresponds with one \( or more \) of the departments \( or ministries \) of the scottish government the current subject committees in the fourth session are economy , energy and tourism education and culture health and sport justice local government and regeneration rural affairs , climate change and environment welfare reform and infrastructure and capital investment
a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government private bills normally relate to large scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property private bill committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the edinburgh tram network , the glasgow airport rail link , the airdrie bathgate rail link and extensions to the national gallery of scotland
the scotland act 1998 , which was passed by the parliament of the united kingdom and given royal assent by queen elizabeth ii on 19 november 1998 , governs the functions and role of the scottish parliament and delimits its legislative competence the scotland act 2012 extends the devolved competencies for the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty , the parliament of the united kingdom at westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of scotland however , under the terms of the scotland act , westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over scottish domestic policy to the scottish parliament such devolved matters include education , health , agriculture and justice the scotland act enabled the scottish parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues a degree of domestic authority , and all foreign policy , remain with the uk parliament in westminster the scottish parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax varying capability another of the roles of the parliament is to hold the scottish government to account
the specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in schedule 5 to the scotland act as reserved matters all matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the scottish parliament most importantly , this includes agriculture , fisheries and forestry , economic development , education , environment , food standards , health , home affairs , scots law courts , police and fire services , local government , sport and the arts , transport , training , tourism , research and statistics and social work the scottish parliament has the ability to alter income tax in scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound the 2012 act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns
reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the scotland parliament the scottish parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to , and dealt with at , westminster \( and where ministerial functions usually lie with uk government ministers \) these include abortion , broadcasting policy , civil service , common markets for uk goods and services , constitution , electricity , coal , oil , gas , nuclear energy , defence and national security , drug policy , employment , foreign policy and relations with europe , most aspects of transport safety and regulation , national lottery , protection of borders , social security and stability of uk 's fiscal , economic and monetary system
bills can be introduced to parliament in a number of ways the scottish government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill a committee of the parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit a member of the scottish parliament can introduce a bill as a private member or a private bill can be submitted to parliament by an outside proposer most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party bills pass through parliament in a number of stages
stage 1 is the first , or introductory stage of the bill , where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to parliament together with its accompanying documents explanatory notes , a policy memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a financial memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it statements from the presiding officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the parliament stage 1 usually takes place , initially , in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill if the whole parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill , it then proceeds to stage 2
stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole parliament this stage comprises two parts consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill opposition members can table wrecking amendments to the bill , designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken after a general debate on the final form of the bill , members proceed to vote at decision time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill
royal assent after the bill has been passed , the presiding officer submits it to the monarch for royal assent and it becomes an act of the scottish parliament however he cannot do so until a 4 week period has elapsed , during which the law officers of the scottish government or uk government can refer the bill to the supreme court of the united kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the parliament acts of the scottish parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula instead they begin with a phrase that reads the bill for this act of the scottish parliament was passed by the parliament on date and received royal assent on date
the party , or parties , that hold the majority of seats in the parliament forms the scottish government in contrast to many other parliamentary systems , parliament elects a first minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term \( after a general election \) any member can put their name forward to be first minister , and a vote is taken by all members of parliament normally , the leader of the largest party is returned as first minister , and head of the scottish government theoretically , parliament also elects the scottish ministers who form the government of scotland and sit in the scottish cabinet , but such ministers are , in practice , appointed to their roles by the first minister junior ministers , who do not attend cabinet , are also appointed to assist scottish ministers in their departments most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected msps , with the exception of scotland 's chief law officers the lord advocate and the solicitor general whilst the first minister chooses the ministers and may decide to remove them at any time the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the sovereign
under the scotland act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years \( 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on \) the date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the monarch on the proposal of the presiding officer if the parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved \( with at least two thirds of the members voting in favour \) , or if the parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be first minister within 28 days of a general election or of the position becoming vacant , the presiding officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the parliament is dissolved by the queen by royal proclamation extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections , unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election , in which case they supplant it the following ordinary election reverts to the first thursday in may , a multiple of four years after 1999 \( i e , 5 may 2011 , 7 may 2015 , etc \)
several procedures enable the scottish parliament to scrutinise the government the first minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to parliament upon which msps are invited to question for example , at the beginning of each parliamentary year , the first minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year after the statement has been delivered , the leaders of the opposition parties and other msps question the first minister on issues related to the substance of the statement
parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber a general question time takes place on a thursday between 11 40 a m and 12 p m where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government at 2 30pm , a 40 minute long themed question time takes place , where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day , such as health and justice or education and transport between 12 p m and 12 30 p m on thursdays , when parliament is sitting , first minister 's question time takes place this gives members an opportunity to question the first minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction opposition leaders ask a general question of the first minister and then supplementary questions such a practice enables a lead in to the questioner , who then uses their supplementary question to ask the first minister any issue the four general questions available to opposition leaders are
of the 129 msps , 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as constituency msps voters choose one member to represent the constituency , and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency msp the 73 scottish parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the uk parliament constituencies in scotland , prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of scottish mps , with the exception of orkney and shetland which each return their own constituency msp currently , the average scottish parliament constituency comprises 55 , 000 electors given the geographical distribution of population in scotland , this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the central lowlands , where the bulk of scotland 's population live , and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country , which have a low population density the island archipelagos of orkney , shetland and the western isles comprise a much smaller number of electors , due to their dispersed population and distance from the scottish parliament in edinburgh if a constituency msp resigns from parliament , this triggers a by election in his or her constituency , where a replacement msp is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system
the total number of seats in the parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'hondt method for example , to determine who is awarded the first list seat , the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region \( at this point just constituency seats \) the party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat this is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated
as in the house of commons , a number of qualifications apply to being an msp such qualifications were introduced under the house of commons disqualification act 1975 and the british nationality act 1981 specifically , members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the united kingdom , the republic of ireland , one of the countries in the commonwealth of nations , a citizen of a british overseas territory , or a european union citizen resident in the uk members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the scottish parliament as elected msps , and similarly , civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified an individual may not sit in the scottish parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the mental health \( care and treatment \) \( scotland \) act 2003
the election produced a majority snp government , making this the first time in the scottish parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority the snp took 16 seats from labour , with many of their key figures not returned to parliament , although labour leader iain gray retained east lothian by 151 votes the snp took a further eight seats from the liberal democrats and one seat from the conservatives the snp overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the scottish parliament to hold a referendum on scottish independence
for the conservatives , the main disappointment was the loss of edinburgh pentlands , the seat of former party leader david mcletchie , to the snp mcletchie was elected on the lothian regional list and the conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats , with leader annabel goldie claiming that their support had held firm nevertheless , she too announced she would step down as leader of the party cameron congratulated the snp on their victory but vowed to campaign for the union in the independence referendum
a procedural consequence of the establishment of the scottish parliament is that scottish mps sitting in the uk house of commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to england , wales and northern ireland whilst english , scottish , welsh and northern irish westminster mps are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the scottish parliament this phenomenon is known as the west lothian question and has led to criticism following the conservative victory in the 2015 uk election , standing orders of the house of commons were changed to give mps representing english constituencies a new veto over laws only affecting england
islamism , also known as political islam \( arabic isl m siy s \) , is an islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism , literalism , and the attempt to implement islamic values in all spheres of life islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the shari'a the different islamist movements have been described as oscillating between two poles at one end is a strategy of islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion at the other reformist pole islamists work to islamize society gradually from the bottom up the movements have arguably altered the middle east more than any trend since the modern states gained independence , redefining politics and even borders according to one journalist \( robin wright \)
moderate and reformist islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the tunisian ennahda movement jamaat e islami of pakistan is basically a socio political and democratic vanguard party but has also gained political influence through military coup d' tat in past the islamist groups like hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in palestine participate in democratic and political process as well as armed attacks , seeking to abolish the state of israel radical islamist organizations like al qaeda and the egyptian islamic jihad , and groups such as the taliban , entirely reject democracy , often declaring as kuffar those muslims who support it \( see takfirism \) , as well as calling for violent offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis
another major division within islamism is between what graham e fuller has described as the fundamentalist guardians of the tradition \( salafis , such as those in the wahhabi movement \) and the vanguard of change and islamic reform centered around the muslim brotherhood olivier roy argues that sunni pan islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century when the muslim brotherhood movement and its focus on islamisation of pan arabism was eclipsed by the salafi movement with its emphasis on sharia rather than the building of islamic institutions , and rejection of shia islam following the arab spring , roy has described islamism as increasingly interdependent with democracy in much of the arab muslim world , such that neither can now survive without the other while islamist political culture itself may not be democratic , islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy at the same time , their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream islamist groups
islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect islam , while the contrary idea that islam is , or can be , apolitical is an error scholars and observers who do not believe that islam is merely a political ideology include fred halliday , john esposito and muslim intellectuals like javed ahmad ghamidi hayri abaza argues the failure to distinguish between islam and islamism leads many in the west to support illiberal islamic regimes , to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics
islamists have asked the question , if islam is a way of life , how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal , social , political , economic , and political spheres of life are not muslims , but islamists and believe in islamism , not just islam \? similarly , a writer for the international crisis group maintains that the conception of 'political islam' is a creation of americans to explain the iranian islamic revolution and apolitical islam was a historical fluke of the short lived era of the heyday of secular arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970 , and it is quietist non political islam , not islamism , that requires explanation
during the 1970s and sometimes later , western and pro western governments often supported sometimes fledgling islamists and islamist groups that later came to be seen as dangerous enemies islamists were considered by western governments bulwarks against what were thought to be at the time more dangerous leftist communist nationalist insurgents opposition , which islamists were correctly seen as opposing the us spent billions of dollars to aid the mujahideen muslim afghanistan enemies of the soviet union , and non afghan veterans of the war returned home with their prestige , experience , ideology , and weapons , and had considerable impact
egyptian president anwar sadat whose policies included opening egypt to western investment \( infitah \) transferring egypt 's allegiance from the soviet union to the united states and making peace with israel released islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists his encouraging of the emergence of the islamist movement was said to have been imitated by many other muslim leaders in the years that followed this gentlemen 's agreement between sadat and islamists broke down in 1975 but not before islamists came to completely dominate university student unions sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in egypt in the 1990s the french government has also been reported to have promoted islamist preachers in the hope of channeling muslim energies into zones of piety and charity
the interpretation of islam promoted by this funding was the strict , conservative saudi based wahhabism or salafism in its harshest form it preached that muslims should not only always oppose infidels in every way , but hate them for their religion for allah 's sake , that democracy is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century , that shia and other non wahhabi muslims were infidels , etc while this effort has by no means converted all , or even most muslims to the wahhabist interpretation of islam , it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations , and has set the saudi interpretation of islam as the gold standard of religion in minds of some or many muslims
islamist movements such as the muslim brotherhood , are well known for providing shelters , educational assistance , free or low cost medical clinics , housing assistance to students from out of town , student advisory groups , facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands , legal assistance , sports facilities , and women 's groups all this compares very favourably against incompetent , inefficient , or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric
while studying law and philosophy in england and germany , iqbal became a member of the london branch of the all india muslim league he came back to lahore in 1908 while dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry , iqbal had remained active in the muslim league he did not support indian involvement in world war i and remained in close touch with muslim political leaders such as muhammad ali johar and muhammad ali jinnah he was a critic of the mainstream indian nationalist and secularist indian national congress iqbal 's seven english lectures were published by oxford university press in 1934 in a book titled the reconstruction of religious thought in islam these lectures dwell on the role of islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age
iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society , but that india 's hindu majority population would crowd out muslim heritage , culture and political influence in his travels to egypt , afghanistan , palestine and syria , he promoted ideas of greater islamic political co operation and unity , calling for the shedding of nationalist differences sir muhammad iqbal was elected president of the muslim league in 1930 at its session in allahabad as well as for the session in lahore in 1932 in his allahabad address on 29 december 1930 , iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for muslim majority provinces in northwestern india this address later inspired the pakistan movement
sayyid abul ala maududi was an important early twentieth century figure in the islamic revival in india , and then after independence from britain , in pakistan trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism , and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about islam and islamic law maududi founded the jamaat e islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972 however , maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising his extremely influential books \( translated into many languages \) placed islam in a modern context , and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer islamists such as al faruqi , whose islamization of knowledge carried forward some of maududi 's key principles
maududi also believed that muslim society could not be islamic without sharia , and islam required the establishment of an islamic state this state should be a theo democracy , based on the principles of tawhid \( unity of god \) , risala \( prophethood \) and khilafa \( caliphate \) although maududi talked about islamic revolution , by revolution he meant not the violence or populist policies of the iranian revolution , but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah
roughly contemporaneous with maududi was the founding of the muslim brotherhood in ismailiyah , egypt in 1928 by hassan al banna his was arguably the first , largest and most influential modern islamic political religious organization under the motto the qur'an is our constitution , it sought islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools , mosques , and workshops like maududi , al banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion , and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the muslim world
some elements of the brotherhood , though perhaps against orders , did engage in violence against the government , and its founder al banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of egypt 's premier mahmud fami naqrashi three months earlier the brotherhood has suffered periodic repression in egypt and has been banned several times , in 1948 and several years later following confrontations with egyptian president gamal abdul nasser , who jailed thousands of members for several years
despite periodic repression , the brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the islamic world , particularly in the arab world for many years it was described as semi legal and was the only opposition group in egypt able to field candidates during elections in the egyptian parliamentary election , 2011 2012 , the political parties identified as islamist \( the brotherhood 's freedom and justice party , salafi al nour party and liberal islamist al wasat party \) won 75 of the total seats mohamed morsi , an islamist democrat of muslim brotherhood , was the first democratically elected president of egypt he was deposed during the 2013 egyptian coup d' tat
the quick and decisive defeat of the arab troops during the six day war by israeli troops constituted a pivotal event in the arab muslim world the defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries , was blamed on the secular arab nationalism of the ruling regimes a steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular , socialist and nationalist politics ensued ba'athism , arab socialism , and arab nationalism suffered , and different democratic and anti democratic islamist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground
the views of ali shariati , ideologue of the iranian revolution , had resemblance with mohammad iqbal , ideological father of the state of pakistan , but khomeini 's beliefs is perceived to be placed somewhere between beliefs of sunni islamic thinkers like mawdudi and qutb he believed that complete imitation of the prophet mohammad and his successors such as ali for restoration of sharia law was essential to islam , that many secular , westernizing muslims were actually agents of the west serving western interests , and that the acts such as plundering of muslim lands was part of a long term conspiracy against islam by the western governments
the islamic republic has also maintained its hold on power in iran in spite of us economic sanctions , and has created or assisted like minded shia terrorist groups in iraq , egypt , syria , jordan \( sciri \) and lebanon \( hezbollah \) \( two muslim countries that also have large shiite populations \) during the 2006 israel lebanon conflict , the iranian government enjoyed something of a resurgence in popularity amongst the predominantly sunni arab street , due to its support for hezbollah and to president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's vehement opposition to the united states and his call that israel shall vanish
in 1979 , the soviet union deployed its 40th army into afghanistan , attempting to suppress an islamic rebellion against an allied marxist regime in the afghan civil war the conflict , pitting indigenous impoverished muslims \( mujahideen \) against an anti religious superpower , galvanized thousands of muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith leading this pan islamic effort was palestinian sheikh abdullah yusuf azzam while the military effectiveness of these afghan arabs was marginal , an estimated 16 , 000 to 35 , 000 muslim volunteers came from around the world came to fight in afghanistan
another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the islamist movement was the gulf war , which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non muslim military personnel to saudi arabian soil to put an end to saddam hussein 's occupation of kuwait prior to 1990 saudi arabia played an important role in restraining the many islamist groups that received its aid but when saddam , secularist and ba'athist dictator of neighboring iraq , attacked saudi arabia \( his enemy in the war \) , western troops came to protect the saudi monarchy islamists accused the saudi regime of being a puppet of the west
these attacks resonated with conservative muslims and the problem did not go away with saddam 's defeat either , since american troops remained stationed in the kingdom , and a de facto cooperation with the palestinian israeli peace process developed saudi arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic islamists who attacked it \( bin laden being a prime example \) , and increasing aid to islamic groups \( islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent islamist groups \) that did not , but its pre war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced one result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in egypt , a bloody civil war in algeria and osama bin laden 's terror attacks climaxing in the 9 11 attack
while qutb 's ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in 1966 , the leadership of the brotherhood , led by hasan al hudaybi , remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of qutb in the mid 1960s \( particularly the manifesto milestones , a k a ma'alim fi l tariq \) did , however , develop and they pursued a more radical direction by the 1970s , the brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals
the path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the egyptian islamic jihad organization responsible for the assassination of anwar sadat in 1981 unlike earlier anti colonial movements the extremist group directed its attacks against what it believed were apostate leaders of muslim states , leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted western foreign ideas and practices into islamic societies its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by muhammad abd al salaam farag , in which he states
another of the egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for islamic order was al gama'a al islamiyya \( islamic group \) victims of their campaign against the egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter terrorism police \( major general raouf khayrat \) , a parliamentary speaker \( rifaat al mahgoub \) , dozens of european tourists and egyptian bystanders , and over 100 egyptian police ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful , and the major jihadi group , jamaa islamiya \( or al gama'a al islamiyya \) , renounced violence in 2003 other lesser known groups include the islamic liberation party , salvation from hell and takfir wal hijra , and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures , arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings
for some decades prior to the first palestine intifada in 1987 , the muslim brotherhood in palestine took a quiescent stance towards israel , focusing on preaching , education and social services , and benefiting from israel 's indulgence to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations as the first intifada gathered momentum and palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising , the brotherhood announced the formation of hamas \( zeal \) , devoted to jihad against israel rather than being more moderate than the plo , the 1988 hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand , calling for the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic state in palestine it was soon competing with and then overtaking the plo for control of the intifada the brotherhood 's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab
hamas has continued to be a major player in palestine from 2000 to 2007 it killed 542 people in 140 suicide bombing or martyrdom operations in the january 2006 legislative election its first foray into the political process it won the majority of the seats , and in 2007 it drove the plo out of gaza hamas has been praised by muslims for driving israel out of the gaza strip , but criticized for failure to achieve its demands in the 2008 9 and 2014 gaza wars despite heavy destruction and significant loss of life
for many years , sudan had an islamist regime under the leadership of hassan al turabi his national islamic front first gained influence when strongman general gaafar al nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979 turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign islamist banking systems , especially those linked with saudi arabia he also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education
after al nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections , but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post al nimeiry government with the help of the military turabi was noted for proclaiming his support for the democratic process and a liberal government before coming to power , but strict application of sharia law , torture and mass imprisonment of the opposition , and an intensification of the long running war in southern sudan , once in power the nif regime also harbored osama bin laden for a time \( before 9 11 \) , and worked to unify islamist opposition to the american attack on iraq in the 1991 gulf war
an islamist movement influenced by salafism and the jihad in afghanistan , as well as the muslim brotherhood , was the fis or front islamique de salut \( the islamic salvation front \) in algeria founded as a broad islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by abbassi madani , and a charismatic islamist young preacher , ali belhadj taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist nationalist fln government , it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following sharia law , economic liberalization and development program , education in arabic rather than french , and gender segregation , with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young algerian men the fis won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d' tat
in afghanistan , the mujahideen 's victory against the soviet union in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity , due to a vicious and destructive civil war between political and tribal warlords , making afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth in 1992 , the democratic republic of afghanistan ruled by communist forces collapsed , and democratic islamist elements of mujahdeen founded the islamic state of afghanistan in 1996 , a more conservative and anti democratic islamist movement known as the taliban rose to power , defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80 of afghanistan
the taliban were spawned by the thousands of madrasahs the deobandi movement established for impoverished afghan refugees and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring pakistan the taliban differed from other islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as islamic fundamentalist or neofundamentalist , interested in spreading an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs under the label of sharia to an entire country their ideology was also described as being influenced by wahhabism , and the extremist jihadism of their guest osama bin laden
in july 1977 , general zia ul haq overthrew prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto 's regime in pakistan ali bhutto , a leftist in democratic competition with islamists , had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months , shortly before he was overthrown zia ul haq was much more committed to islamism , and islamization or implementation of islamic law , became a cornerstone of his eleven year military dictatorship and islamism became his official state ideology zia ul haq was an admirer of mawdudi and mawdudi 's party jamaat e islami became the regime 's ideological and political arm in pakistan this islamization from above was probably more complete than under any other regime except those in iran and sudan , but zia ul haq was also criticized by many islamists for imposing symbols rather than substance , and using islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power unlike neighboring iran , zia ul haq 's policies were intended to avoid revolutionary excess , and not to strain relations with his american and persian gulf state allies zia ul haq was killed in 1988 but islamization remains an important element in pakistani society
the islamic state , formerly known as the islamic state of iraq and the levant and before that as the islamic state of iraq , \( and called the acronym daesh by its many detractors \) , is a wahhabi salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of sunni arabs from iraq and syria in 2014 , the group proclaimed itself a caliphate , with religious , political and military authority over all muslims worldwide as of march 2015 update , it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in iraq and syria , and has nominal control over small areas of libya , nigeria and afghanistan \( while a self described state , it lacks international recognition \) the group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world , including north africa and south asia
originating as the jama'at al tawhid wal jihad in 1999 , it pledged allegiance to al qaeda in 2004 , participated in the iraqi insurgency that followed the march 2003 invasion of iraq by western forces , joined the fight in the syrian civil war beginning in march 2011 , and was expelled from al qaeda in early 2014 , \( which complained of its failure to consult and notorious intransigence \) the group gained prominence after it drove iraqi government forces out of key cities in western iraq in a 2014 offensive the group is adept at social media , posting internet videos of beheadings of soldiers , civilians , journalists and aid workers , and is known for its destruction of cultural heritage sites the united nations has held isil responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes , and amnesty international has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a historic scale the group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the united nations , the european union and member states , the united states , india , indonesia , turkey , saudi arabia , syria and other countries
in its focus on the caliphate , the party takes a different view of muslim history than some other islamists such as muhammad qutb ht sees islam 's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of ali , or one of the other four rightly guided caliphs in the 7th century , but with the abolition of the ottoman caliphate in 1924 this is believed to have ended the true islamic system , something for which it blames the disbelieving \( kafir \) colonial powers working through turkish modernist mustafa kemal atat rk
ht does not engage in armed jihad or work for a democratic system , but works to take power through ideological struggle to change muslim public opinion , and in particular through elites who will facilitate a change of the government , i e , launch a bloodless coup it allegedly attempted and failed such coups in 1968 and 1969 in jordan , and in 1974 in egypt , and is now banned in both countries but many ht members have gone on to join terrorist groups and many jihadi terrorists have cited ht as their key influence
greater london has over 900 , 000 muslims , \( most of south asian origins and concentrated in the east london boroughs of newham , tower hamlets and waltham forest \) , and among them are some with a strong islamist outlook their presence , combined with a perceived british policy of allowing them free rein , heightened by expos s such as the 2007 channel 4 documentary programme undercover mosque , has given rise to the term londonistan following the 9 11 attacks , however , abu hamza al masri , the imam of the finsbury park mosque , was arrested and charged with incitement to terrorism which has caused many islamists to leave the uk to avoid internment citation needed
the u s government has engaged in efforts to counter islamism , or violent islamism , since 2001 these efforts were centred in the u s around public diplomacy programmes conducted by the state department there have been calls to create an independent agency in the u s with a specific mission of undermining islamism and jihadism christian whiton , an official in the george w bush administration , called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of political warfare aimed at undermining the ideology u s defense secretary robert gates called for establishing something similar to the defunct u s information agency , which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the cold war
imperialism is a type of advocacy of empire its name originated from the latin word imperium , which means to rule over large territories imperialism is a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas the term imperialism has been applied to western \( and japanese \) political and economic dominance especially in asia and africa in the 19th and 20th centuries its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars some writers , such as edward said , use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery
imperialism is defined as a policy of extending a country s power and influence through diplomacy or military force imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group , often a state power , has on another group of people this is often through various forms of othering \( see other \) based on racial , religious , or cultural stereotypes there are formal or informal imperialisms formal imperialism is defined as physical control or full fledged colonial rule informal imperialism is less direct however , it is still a powerful form of dominance
the definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers , or simply , general purpose aggressiveness further on , some writers who \? used the term imperialism , in slightly more discriminating fashion , to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another to clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of formal and informal imperialism , the first meaning physical control or full fledged colonial rule while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally this is because , with informal rule , the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority , enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid , ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area , or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully
the word empire comes from the latin word imperium for which the closest modern english equivalent would perhaps be sovereignty , or simply rule the greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded political power grew from conquering land , however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes a distinction about empires is that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland , economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products european empires in asia and africa have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the european seaborne empires european expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory the two main regions are the core and the periphery the core consists of high areas of income and profit the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit these critical theories of geo politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post colonial world the russian leader lenin suggested that imperialism was the highest form of capitalism , claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism , and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism this idea from lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations
the term imperialism is often conflated with colonialism , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power particularly , edward said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating imperialism involved 'the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory' , while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory ' contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism 116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus further explanation needed
imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control , yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other , if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another , imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance , either formally or informally colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled colonialism 's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war the meaning of imperialism is to create an empire , by conquering the other state 's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region colonialism can completely change the existing social structure , physical structure and economics of an area it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations
a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire building based on seemingly rational grounds j a hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as it is desirable that the earth should be peopled , governed , and developed , as far as possible , by the races which can do this work best , i e by the races of highest 'social efficiency' many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive , imperialism was needed halford mackinder felt that great britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism the purportedly scientific nature of social darwinism and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose , for example throughout latin america whiteness is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento \( whitening \) are common
the royal geographical society of london and other geographical societies in europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries these societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories political geographers such as friedrich ratzel of germany and halford mackinder of britain also supported imperialism ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state s survival while mackinder supported britain s imperial expansion these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades
geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance for instance , american geographer ellen churchill semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone tropicality can be paralleled with edward said s orientalism as the west s construction of the east as the other according to siad , orientalism allowed europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm , which justified its dominance over the essentialized orient
the principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the british empire during the last generation , and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius \( latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'empty land' \) the country of australia serves as a case study in relation to british settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century , as it was premised on terra nullius , and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse aboriginal inhabitants
orientalism , as theorized by edward said , refers to how the west developed an imaginative geography of the east this imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the east rather , by essentializing the east , this discourse uses the idea of place based identities to create difference and distance between we the west and them the east , or here in the west and there in the east this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west defining the east as a negative vision of itself , as its inferior , not only increased the west s sense of self , but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled the discourse of orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early western imperialism , as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social , cultural , political , and economic control of other territories
to better illustrate this idea , bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth century maps during the scramble for africa he states that maps contributed to empire by promoting , assisting , and legitimizing the extension of french and british power into west africa during his analysis of nineteenth century cartographic techniques , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory this provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps
imperialism has played an important role in the histories of japan , korea , the assyrian empire , the chinese empire , the roman empire , greece , the byzantine empire , the persian empire , the ottoman empire , ancient egypt , the british empire , india , and many other empires imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of genghis khan during the mongol empire , and of other war lords historically recognized muslim empires number in the dozens sub saharan africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the european colonial era , for example the ethiopian empire , oyo empire , asante union , luba empire , lunda empire , and mutapa empire the americas during the pre columbian era also had large empires such as the aztec empire and the incan empire
cultural imperialism is when a country 's influence is felt in social and cultural circles , i e its soft power , such that it changes the moral , cultural and societal worldview of another this is more than just foreign music , television or film becoming popular with young people , but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted for example , depictions of opulent american lifestyles in the soap opera dallas during the cold war changed the expectations of romanians a more recent example is the influence of smuggled south korean drama series in north korea the importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes , fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture , control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc nor is such a usage of culture recent , as part of roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of roman culture and lifestyle , with the aim that they would then become willing participants
the age of imperialism , a time period beginning around 1700 , saw \( generally european \) industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing , influencing , and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power citation needed although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years , the term age of imperialism generally refers to the activities of european powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century , for example , the the great game in persian lands , the scramble for africa and the open door policy in china
during the 20th century , historians john gallagher \( 1919 1980 \) and ronald robinson \( 1920 1999 \) constructed a framework for understanding european imperialism they claim that european imperialism was influential , and europeans rejected the notion that imperialism required formal , legal control by one government over another country in their view , historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red the bulk of british emigration , trade , and capital went to areas outside the formal british empire key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary ' attribution needed because of the resources made available by imperialism , the world 's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before world war i , making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous
europe 's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies , in combination with assuming political control by military and political means the colonization of india in the mid 18th century offers an example of this focus there , the british exploited the political weakness of the mughal state , and , while military activity was important at various times , the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance for the establishment of control over the subcontinent 's resources , markets , and manpower although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , fieldhouse suggests that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in places such as africa and asia , this idea is not necessarily valid
along with advancements in communication , europe also continued to advance in military technology european chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat , and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms by the 1880s , the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon this technology gave european armies an advantage over their opponents , as armies in less developed countries were still fighting with arrows , swords , and leather shields \( e g the zulus in southern africa during the anglo zulu war of 1879 \)
in anglophone academic works , theories regarding imperialism are often based on the british experience the term imperialism was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli it was shortly appropriated by supporters of imperialism such as joseph chamberlain for some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy others alleged that it was characterized by political self interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed liberal john a hobson and marxist vladimir lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism in his writings lenin portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later marxist theoreticians many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of imperialism such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy , nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century , but a world system extending over a period of centuries , often going back to christopher columbus and , in some accounts , to the crusades as the application of the term has expanded , its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes the moral , the economic , the systemic , the cultural , and the temporal those changes reflect among other shifts in sensibility a growing unease , even squeamishness , with the fact of power , specifically , western power
the correlation between capitalism , aristocracy , and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as j a hobson \( 1858 1940 \) , joseph schumpeter \( 1883 1950 \) , thorstein veblen \( 1857 1929 \) , and norman angell \( 1872 1967 \) while these non marxist writers were at their most prolific before world war i , they remained active in the interwar years their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it 's impact on europe , as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military political complex in the united states from the 1950s hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption , create wealth , and encourage a peaceful , tolerant , multipolar world order
the concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples it was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination for example , people living in tropical environments were seen as less civilized therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission across the three waves of european colonialism \( first in the americas , second in asia and lastly in africa \) , environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy this takes two forms , orientalism and tropicality
according to geographic scholars under colonizing empires , the world could be split into climatic zones these scholars believed that northern europe and the mid atlantic temperate climate produced a hard working , moral , and upstanding human being alternatively , tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes , sexual promiscuity , exotic culture , and moral degeneracy the people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the european empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure they were seen as incapable of such a feat similarly , orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location
britain 's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century in 1599 the british east india company was established and was chartered by queen elizabeth in the following year with the establishment of trading posts in india , the british were able to maintain strength relative to others empires such as the portuguese who already had set up trading posts in india in 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the east india company causing the plundering of the local economy , almost bringing the company into bankruptcy
france took control of algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850 , concentrating chiefly in north and west africa , as well as south east asia , with other conquests in central and east africa , as well as the south pacific republicans , at first hostile to empire , only became supportive when germany started to build her own colonial empire as it developed , the new empire took on roles of trade with france , supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items , as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading french civilization and language as well as catholicism it also provided crucial manpower in both world wars
it became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture in 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism , jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission the higher races have a right over the lower races , they have a duty to civilize the inferior full citizenship rights assimilation were offered , although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon contrasting from britain , france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies , with the only notable exception of algeria , where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority
in world war ii , charles de gaulle and the free french used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate france however after 1945 anti colonial movements began to challenge the empire france fought and lost a bitter war in vietnam in the 1950s whereas they won the war in algeria , the french leader at the time , charles de gaulle , decided to grant algeria independence anyway in 1962 its settlers and many local supporters relocated to france nearly all of france 's colonies gained independence by 1960 , but france retained great financial and diplomatic influence it has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d tat
from their original homelands in scandinavia and northern europe , germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western europe in the middle period of classical antiquity southern europe in late antiquity , conquering celtic and other peoples and by 800 ce , forming the holy roman empire , the first german empire however , there was no real systemic continuity from the western roman empire to its german successor which was famously described as not holy , not roman , and not an empire , as a great number of small states and principalities existed in the loosely autonomous confederation although by 1000 ce , the germanic conquest of central , western , and southern europe \( west of and including italy \) was complete , excluding only muslim iberia there was , however , little cultural integration or national identity , and germany remained largely a conceptual term referring to an amorphous area of central europe
not a maritime power , and not a nation state , as it would eventually become , germany s participation in western imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century the participation of austria was primarily as a result of habsburg control of the first empire , the spanish throne , and other royal houses further explanation needed after the defeat of napoleon , who caused the dissolution of that holy roman empire , prussia and the german states continued to stand aloof from imperialism , preferring to manipulate the european system through the concert of europe after prussia unified the other states into the second german empire after the franco german war , its long time chancellor , otto von bismarck \( 1862 90 \) , long opposed colonial acquisitions , arguing that the burden of obtaining , maintaining , and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits he felt that colonies did not pay for themselves , that the german bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract germany from its central interest , europe itself
however , in 1883 84 germany began to build a colonial empire in africa and the south pacific , before losing interest in imperialism historians have debated exactly why germany made this sudden and short lived move verification needed bismarck was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of german prestige he was influenced by hamburg merchants and traders , his neighbors at friedrichsruh the establishment of the german colonial empire proceeded smoothly , starting with german new guinea in 1884
during the first sino japanese war in 1894 , japan absorbed taiwan as a result of the russo japanese war in 1905 , japan took part of sakhalin island from russia korea was annexed in 1910 during world war i , japan took german leased territories in china s shandong province , as well as the mariana , caroline , and marshall islands in 1918 , japan occupied parts of far eastern russia and parts of eastern siberia as a participant in the siberian intervention in 1931 japan conquered manchuria from china during the second sino japanese war in 1937 , japan 's military invaded central china and by the end of the pacific war , japan had conquered much of the far east , including hong kong , vietnam , cambodia , myanmar , the philippines , indonesia , part of new guinea and some islands of the pacific ocean japan also invaded thailand , pressuring the country into a thai japanese alliance its colonial ambitions were ended by the victory of the united states in the second world war and the following treaties which remanded those territories to american administration or their original owners
bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921 , however with an internationalist ideology lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self determination for national minorities within the new territory beginning in 1923 , the policy of indigenization korenizatsiia was intended to support non russians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework never formally revoked , it stopped being implemented after 1932 after world war ii , the soviet union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919 20 in the old tsarist empire in areas its forces occupied in eastern europe the soviet union and the people s republic of china supported post world war ii communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests , but were not always successful
trotsky , and others , believed that the revolution could only succeed in russia as part of a world revolution lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism however , after lenin 's death , joseph stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the soviet union , creating the model for subsequent inward looking stalinist states and purging the early internationalist elements the internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the americans during the cold war with the beginning of the new era , the after stalin period called the thaw , in the late 1950s , the new political leader nikita khrushchev put even more pressure on the soviet american relations starting a new wave of anti imperialist propaganda in his speech on the un conference in 1960 , he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism , stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders although the soviet union declared itself anti imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires some scholars hold that the soviet union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states it has also been argued that the ussr practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old russian tradition of expansion and control mao zedong once argued that the soviet union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa ade moreover , the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government non russian marxists within the russian federation and later the ussr , like sultan galiev and vasyl shakhrai , considered the soviet regime a renewed version of the russian imperialism and colonialism
the first british empire was based on mercantilism , and involved colonies and holdings primarily in north america , the caribbean , and india its growth was reversed by the loss of the american colonies in 1776 britain made compensating gains in india , australia , and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in latin america after the independence of spanish and portuguese colonies about 1820 by the 1840s , britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world after losing its first empire to the americans , britain then turned its attention towards asia , africa , and the pacific following the defeat of napoleonic france in 1815 , britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century
a resurgence came in the late 19th century , with the scramble for africa and major additions in asia and the middle east the british spirit of imperialism was expressed by joseph chamberlain and lord rosebury , and implemented in africa by cecil rhodes the pseudo sciences of social darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time other influential spokesmen included lord cromer , lord curzon , general kitchner , lord milner , and the writer rudyard kipling the british empire was the largest empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population its power , both military and economic , remained unmatched
the early united states expressed its opposition to imperialism , at least in a form distinct from its own manifest destiny , through policies such as the monroe doctrine however , beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century , policies such as theodore roosevelt s interventionism in central america and woodrow wilson s mission to make the world safe for democracy changed all this they were often backed by military force , but were more often affected from behind the scenes this is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires in 1898 , americans who opposed imperialism created the anti imperialist league to oppose the us annexation of the philippines and cuba one year later , a war erupted in the philippines causing business , labor and government leaders in the us to condemn america 's occupation in the philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many filipinos american foreign policy was denounced as a racket by smedley butler , an american general he said , looking back on it , i might have given al capone a few hints the best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts i operated on three continents
one key figure in the plans for what would come to be known as american empire , was a geographer named isiah bowman bowman was the director of the american geographical society in 1914 three years later in 1917 , he was appointed to then president woodrow wilson 's inquiry in 1917 the inquiry was the idea of president wilson and the american delegation from the paris peace conference the point of this inquiry was to build a premise that would allow for u s authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order as a result of his role in the inquiry , isiah bowman would come to be known as wilson 's geographer
some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism this internal form is distinct from informal u s imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony this internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the united states' formation of colonies abroad through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion , the united states took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism this internal form of empire has been referred to as internal colonialism participation in the african slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of america 's internal colonialism however , this internal colonialism faced resistance , as external colonialism did , but the anti colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the united states was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and african americans in his lecture on april 16 , 2003 , edward said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the united states , whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary orient , due to their backward living , lack of democracy and the violation of women s rights the western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon
the ottoman empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923 during the 16th and 17th centuries , in particular at the height of its power under the reign of suleiman the magnificent , the ottoman empire was a powerful multinational , multilingual empire controlling much of southeast europe , western asia , the caucasus , north africa , and the horn of africa at the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states some of these were later absorbed into the empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries
with istanbul as its capital and control of lands around the mediterranean basin , the ottoman empire was at the center of interactions between the eastern and western worlds for six centuries following a long period of military setbacks against european powers , the ottoman empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century the empire allied with germany in the early 20th century , with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories , but it dissolved in the aftermath of world war i , leading to the emergence of the new state of turkey in the ottoman anatolian heartland , as well as the creation of modern balkan and middle eastern states , thus ending turkish colonial ambitions
the united methodist church \( umc \) is a mainline protestant methodist denomination in the 19th century its main predecessor was a leader in evangelicalism founded in 1968 by the union of the methodist church \( usa \) and the evangelical united brethren church , the umc traces its roots back to the revival movement of john and charles wesley in england as well as the great awakening in the united states as such , the church 's theological orientation is decidedly wesleyan it embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements
the united methodist church is the largest denomination within the wider methodist movement , which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world in the united states , the umc ranks as the largest mainline protestant denomination , the largest protestant church after the southern baptist convention , and the third largest christian denomination as of 2014 , worldwide membership was about 12 million 7 2 million in the united states , and 4 4 million in africa , asia and europe it is a member of the world council of churches , the world methodist council , and other religious associations in 2015 , pew research estimated that 3 6 of the u s population , or 9 million adult adherents , self identify with the united methodist church revealing a much larger number of adherents than registered membership
the movement which would become the united methodist church began in the mid 18th century within the church of england a small group of students , including john wesley , charles wesley and george whitefield , met on the oxford university campus they focused on bible study , methodical study of scripture and living a holy life other students mocked them , saying they were the holy club and the methodists , being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their bible study , opinions and disciplined lifestyle eventually , the so called methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the church of england who wanted to live a more religious life
in 1735 , john and charles wesley went to america to teach the gospel to the american indians in the colony of georgia in less than two years , the holy club disbanded john wesley returned to england and met with a group of clergy he respected he said they appeared to be of one heart , as well as of one judgment , resolved to be bible christians at all events and , wherever they were , to preach with all their might plain , old , bible christianity the ministers retained their membership in the church of england though not always emphasized or appreciated in the anglican churches of their day , their teaching emphasized salvation by god 's grace , acquired through faith in christ three teachings they saw as the foundation of christian faith were
though john wesley originally wanted the methodists to stay within the church of england , the american revolution decisively separated the methodists in the american colonies from the life and sacraments of the anglican church in 1784 , after unsuccessful attempts to have the church of england send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies , wesley decisively appointed fellow priest thomas coke as superintendent \( bishop \) to organize a separate methodist society together with coke , wesley sent a revision of the anglican prayerbook and the articles of religion which were received and adopted by the baltimore christmas conference of 1784 , officially establishing the methodist episcopal church the conference was held at the lovely lane methodist church , considered the mother church of american methodism
st george 's united methodist church , located at the corner of 4th and new streets , in the old city neighborhood of philadelphia , is the oldest methodist church in continuous use in the united states , beginning in 1769 the congregation was founded in 1767 , meeting initially in a sail loft on dock street , and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a german reformed congregation at this time , methodists had not yet broken away from the anglican church and the methodist episcopal church was not founded until 1784
richard allen and absalom jones became the first african americans ordained by the methodist church they were licensed by st george 's church in 1784 three years later , protesting racial segregation in the worship services , allen led most of the black members out of st george 's eventually they founded the mother bethel a m e church and the african methodist episcopal denomination absalom jones became an episcopal priest in 1836 , the church 's basement was excavated to make room for a sunday school in the 1920s a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the benjamin franklin bridge the case resulted in the bridge being relocated historic st georges welcomes visitors and is home to archives and a museum on methodism
in the more than 220 years since 1784 , methodism in the united states , like many other protestant denominations , has seen a number of divisions and mergers in 1830 , the methodist protestant church split from the methodist episcopal church over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church , insisting that clergy should not be the only ones to have any determination in how the church was to be operated in 1844 , the general conference of the methodist episcopal church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination
on april 23 , 1968 , the united methodist church was created when the evangelical united brethren church \( represented by bishop reuben h mueller \) and the methodist church \( represented by bishop lloyd christ wicke \) joined hands at the constituting general conference in dallas , texas with the words , lord of the church , we are united in thee , in thy church and now in the united methodist church the new denomination was given birth by the two churches that had distinguished histories and influential ministries in various parts of the world
the united methodist church understands itself to be part of the holy catholic \( or universal \) church and it recognizes the historic ecumenical creeds , the apostle 's creed and the nicene creed which are used frequently in services of worship the book of discipline also recognizes the importance of the chalcedonian creed of the council of chalcedon it upholds the concept of the visible and invisible church , meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy church invisible , while the united methodist church is a branch of the church visible , to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the word of god is preached and the sacraments are administered
some argue that the united methodist church can lay a claim on apostolic succession , as understood in the traditional sense as a result of the american revolution , john wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters , thomas vasey and richard whatcoat dr thomas coke , already an anglican priest , assisted wesley in this action coke was then set apart as a superintendent \( bishop \) by wesley and dispatched with vasey and whatcoat to america to take charge of methodist activities there in defense of his action to ordain , wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the church of alexandria , which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore , bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate he knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the church of alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the ancient church methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds
while many united methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition , others reflect the mainline protestant traditions although united methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time , these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church 's founders , especially john wesley and charles wesley \( anglicans \) , but also philip william otterbein and martin boehm \( united brethren \) , and jacob albright \( evangelical association \) with the formation of the united methodist church in 1968 , theologian albert c outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine outler 's work proved pivotal in the work of union , and he is largely considered the first united methodist theologian
prevenient grace , or the grace that goes before us , is given to all people it is that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with god through jesus christ this grace is the present work of god to turn us from our sin corrupted human will to the loving will of the father in this work , god desires that we might sense both our sinfulness before god and god 's offer of salvation prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject god 's salvation in christ
justifying grace or accepting grace is that grace , offered by god to all people , that we receive by faith and trust in christ , through which god pardons the believer of sin it is in justifying grace we are received by god , in spite of our sin in this reception , we are forgiven through the atoning work of jesus christ on the cross the justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love god and neighbor today , justifying grace is also known as conversion , accepting jesus as your personal lord and savior , or being born again john wesley originally called this experience the new birth this experience can occur in different ways it can be one transforming moment , such as an altar call experience , or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time

wesleyan theology stands at a unique cross roads between evangelical and sacramental , between liturgical and charismatic , and between anglo catholic and reformed theology and practice it has been characterized as arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the holy spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer the united methodist church believes in prima scriptura , seeing the holy bible as the primary authority in the church and using sacred tradition , reason , and experience to interpret it , with the aid of the holy spirit \( see wesleyan quadrilateral \) therefore , according to the book of discipline , united methodist theology is at once catholic , evangelical , and reformed today , the umc is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race , gender , and ideology , though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes comparatively , the umc stands to the right of liberal and progressive protestant groups such as the united church of christ and the episcopal church on certain issues \( especially regarding sexuality \) , but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the southern baptists and pentecostalism , in regard to theological matters such as social justice and biblical interpretation however , it should be noted that the umc is made up of a broad diversity of thought , and so there are many clergy and laity within the umc that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters

historically , the methodist church has supported the temperance movement john wesley warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon , the use of money , and in his letter to an alcoholic at one time , methodist ministers had to take a pledge not to drink and encouraged their congregations to do the same today the united methodist church states that it affirms our long standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to god 's liberating and redeeming love for persons in fact , the united methodist church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of holy communion , thus expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics , enabling the participation of children and youth , and supporting the church 's witness of abstinence moreover , in 2011 and 2012 , the united methodist church 's general board of church and society called on all united methodists to abstain from alcohol for lent

the united methodist church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of scripture therefore , the church supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war , or any particular war , and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription however , the united methodist church also supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service the church also states that as christians they are aware that neither the way of military action , nor the way of inaction is always righteous before god
the united methodist church maintains that war is incompatible with christ 's message and teachings therefore , the church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy , to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide , brutal suppression of human rights , and unprovoked international aggression it insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped that the manufacture , sale , and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled and that the production , possession , or use of nuclear weapons be condemned consequently , the united methodist church endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control

the common pattern comes from john wesley , who wrote that there is no liturgy in the world , either in ancient or modern language , which breathes more of a solid , scriptural , rational piety , than the common prayer of the church of england when the methodists in america were separated from the church of england , john wesley himself provided a revised version of the book of common prayer called the sunday service of the methodists in north america wesley 's sunday service has shaped the official liturgies of the methodists ever since
like other historic christian churches , the united methodist church has official liturgies for services of holy communion , baptism , weddings , funerals , ordination , anointing of the sick and daily office prayer services some clergy offer healing services , while exorcism is an occasional practice by some clergy in the united methodist church in africa these services involve the laying on of hands and anointing with oil along with these , there are also special services for holy days such as all saints day , ash wednesday , maundy thursday , good friday , and easter vigil these services are contained in the united methodist hymnal and the united methodist book of worship \( 1992 \) many of these liturgies are derived from the anglican tradition 's book of common prayer in most cases , congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship , such as candles , vestments , paraments , banners , and liturgical art
methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure \( e g , st james umc \) methodists also honor notable heroes and heroines of the christian faith and look to these prominent saints as providing examples of holy living and commitment to christ that are worthy of imitation \( see 1 corinthians 11 1 \) such exemplary saints include martyrs , confessors of the faith , evangelists , or important biblical figures such as saint matthew , lutheran theologian and martyr to the nazis dietrich bonhoeffer , salvation army founder william booth , african missionary david livingstone and methodism 's revered founder john wesley are among many cited as protestant saints
the united methodist church is organized into conferences the highest level is called the general conference and is the only organization which may speak officially for the church the general conference meets every four years \( quadrennium \) legislative changes are recorded in the book of discipline which is revised after each general conference non legislative resolutions are recorded in the book of resolutions , which is published after each general conference , and expire after eight years unless passed again by a subsequent session of general conference the last general conference was held in tampa , florida , in 2012 the event is currently rotated between the u s jurisdictions of the church the 2016 general conference will be in portland , oregon bishops , councils , committees , boards , elders , etc , are not permitted to speak on behalf of the united methodist church as this authority is reserved solely for the general conference in accordance with the book of discipline
subordinate to the general conference are the jurisdictional and central conferences which also meet every four years the united states is divided into five jurisdictions northeastern , southeastern , north central , south central and western outside the united states the church is divided into seven central conferences africa , congo , west africa , central southern europe , germany , northern europe and the philippines the main purpose of the jurisdictions and central conferences is to elect and appoint bishops , the chief administrators of the church bishops thus elected serve episcopal areas , which consist of one or more annual conferences
decisions in between the four year meetings are made by the mission council \( usually consisting of church bishops \) one of the most high profile decisions in recent years by one of the councils was a decision by the mission council of the south central jurisdiction which in march 2007 approved a 99 year lease of 36 acres \( 150 , 000 m2 \) at southern methodist university for the george w bush presidential library the decision generated controversy in light of bush 's support of the iraq war which the church bishops have criticized a debate over whether the decision should or could be submitted for approval by the southern jurisdictional conference at its july 2008 meeting in dallas , texas , remains unresolved
the judicial council is the highest court in the denomination it consists of nine members , both laity and clergy , elected by the general conference for an eight year term the ratio of laity to clergy alternates every eight years the judicial council interprets the book of discipline between sessions of general conference , and during general conference , the judicial council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by general conference the council also determines whether actions of local churches , annual conferences , church agencies , and bishops are in accordance with church law the council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops the judicial council cannot create any legislation it can only interpret existing legislation the council meets twice a year at various locations throughout the world the judicial council also hears appeals from those who have been accused of chargeable offenses that can result in defrocking or revocation of membership
the annual conference , roughly the equivalent of a diocese in the anglican communion and the roman catholic church or a synod in some lutheran denominations such as the evangelical lutheran church in america , is the basic unit of organization within the umc the term annual conference is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting clergy are members of their annual conference rather than of any local congregation , and are appointed to a local church or other charge annually by the conference 's resident bishop at the meeting of the annual conference in many ways , the united methodist church operates in a connectional organization of the annual conferences , and actions taken by one conference are not binding upon another
the book of discipline is the guidebook for local churches and pastors and describes in considerable detail the organizational structure of local united methodist churches all um churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members and it is recommended that no gender should hold more than a 2 3 majority all churches must also have a nominations committee , a finance committee and a church council or administrative council other committees are suggested but not required such as a missions committee , or evangelism or worship committee term limits are set for some committees but not for all the church conference is an annual meeting of all the officers of the church and any interested members this committee has the exclusive power to set pastors' salaries \( compensation packages for tax purposes \) and to elect officers to the committees
throughout its history , the united methodist church has placed great emphasis on the importance of education as such , the united methodist church established and is affiliated with around one hundred colleges and universities in the united states , including syracuse university , boston university , emory university , duke university , drew university , university of denver , university of evansville , and southern methodist university most are members of the international association of methodist related schools , colleges , and universities the church operates three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas
the first methodist clergy were ordained by john wesley , a priest of the church of england , because of the crisis caused by the american revolution which isolated the methodists in the states from the church of england and its sacraments today , the clergy includes men and women who are ordained by bishops as elders and deacons and are appointed to various ministries elders in the united methodist church itenerate and are subject to the authority and appointment of their bishops they generally serve as pastors in local congregations deacons are in service ministry and may serve as musicians , liturgists , educators , business administrators , and a number of other areas elders and deacons are required to obtain a master 's degree \( generally an m div \) , or another equivalent degree , before commissioning and then ultimately ordination elders in full connection are each a member of their annual conference order of elders likewise each deacon in full connection is a member of their annual conference order of deacons
all clergy appointments are made and fixed annually by the resident bishop on the advice of the annual conference cabinet , which is composed of the area provost dean \( if one is appointed \) and the several district superintendents of the districts of the annual conference until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the annual conference , no appointments are officially fixed many annual conferences try to avoid making appointment changes between sessions of annual conference while an appointment is made one year at a time , it is most common for an appointment to be continued for multiple years appointment tenures in extension ministries , such as military chaplaincy , campus ministry , missions , higher education and other ministries beyond the local church are often even longer
elders are called by god , affirmed by the church , and ordained by a bishop to a ministry of word , sacrament , order and service within the church they may be appointed to the local church , or to other valid extension ministries of the church elders are given the authority to preach the word of god , administer the sacraments of the church , to provide care and counseling , and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission elders may also be assigned as district superintendents , and they are eligible for election to the episcopacy elders serve a term of 2 3 years as provisional elders prior to their ordination
deacons are called by god , affirmed by the church , and ordained by a bishop to servant leadership within the church they are ordained to ministries of word , service , compassion , and justice they may be appointed to ministry within the local church or to an extension ministry that supports the mission of the church deacons give leadership , preach the word , contribute in worship , conduct marriages , bury the dead , and aid the church in embodying its mission within the world deacons assist elders in the sacraments of holy communion and baptism , and may be granted sacramental authority if they are appointed as the pastor in a local church deacons serve a term of 2 3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination
at the 1996 general conference the ordination order of transitional deacon was abolished this created new orders known as provisional elder or provisional deacon for those who seek to be ordained in the respective orders the provisional elder deacon is a seminary graduate who serves a two three year term in a full time appointment after being commissioned during this two or three year period , the provisional elder is granted sacramental ministry in their local appointment for the first time in its history non ordained pastors became a normal expectation , rather than an extraordinary provision for ministry
local pastors are called by god , affirmed by the church , and appointed by a bishop to a ministry of word , sacrament , order and service within the church the local pastor are given the authority to preach the word of god , administer the sacraments of the church , to provide care and counseling , and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission , but are not ordained when elders are not available to be appointed to a local church , either through shortage of personnel or financial hardship of a pastoral charge , the bishop may appoint a local pastor to serve the pastoral appointment local pastors are often bi vocational , living out their ministerial call in the local church and in their field of employment full time and part time licensed local pastors under appointment are clergy and hold membership in the annual conference and not in the local church a local pastor 's official title is 'licensed local pastor' and is appointed as clergy to the local church where they preach , conduct divine worship and perform the regular duties of a pastor the licensed local pastor has the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment and shall not extend beyond it local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and attend and pass an approved five year course of study at an approved united methodist seminary or course of study school , successfully complete written and oral examinations , and appear before the district committee on ministry and the conference board of ordained ministry they may continue towards associate membership allowing them to retire as clergy they also may continue towards ordination if they complete their bachelor 's degree , requirements of their particular conference board of ordained ministry , as well as an advanced course or study or prescribed seminary courses at an approved seminary upon retirement , local pastors return to their charge conference as lay members
the united methodist church \( umc \) practices infant and adult baptism baptized members are those who have been baptized as an infant or child , but who have not subsequently professed their own faith these baptized members become professing members through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith individuals who were not previously baptized are baptized as part of their profession of faith and thus become professing members in this manner individuals may also become a professing member through transfer from another christian denomination
unlike confirmation and profession of faith , baptism is a sacrament in the umc the book of discipline of the united methodist church directs the local church to offer membership preparation or confirmation classes to all people , including adults the term confirmation is generally reserved for youth , while some variation on membership class is generally used for adults wishing to join the church the book of discipline normally allows any youth at least completing sixth grade to participate , although the pastor has discretionary authority to allow a younger person to participate in confirmation and membership preparation classes , students learn about church and the methodist christian theological tradition in order to profess their ultimate faith in christ
another position in the united methodist church is that of the lay servant although not considered clergy , lay speakers often preach during services of worship when an ordained elder , local pastor , associate member or deacon is unavailable there are two categories of lay servants local church lay servant , who serve in and through their local churches , and certified lay servants , who serve in their own churches , in other churches , and through district or conference projects and programs to be recognized as local church lay servant , they must be recommended by their pastor and church council or charge conference , and complete the basic course for lay servant each year they must reapply , reporting how they have served and continued to learn during that year to be recognized as certified lay servant , they must be recommended by their pastor and church council or charge conference , complete the basic course and one advanced lay servant course , and be interviewed by the district or conference committee on lay speaking they must report and reapply annually and they must complete at least one advanced course every three years
the united methodist church is one tradition within the christian church the united methodist church is active in ecumenical relations with other christian groups and denominations it is a member of the national council of churches , the world council of churches , churches uniting in christ , and christian churches together in addition , it voted to seek observer status in the national association of evangelicals and in the world evangelical fellowship however , there are some in the united methodist church who feel that false ecumenism might result in the blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity
the united methodist church has since 1985 been exploring a possible merger with three historically african american methodist denominations the african methodist episcopal church , the african methodist episcopal zion church , and the christian methodist episcopal church a commission on pan methodist cooperation and union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger in may 2012 , the united methodist church entered into full communion with the african methodist episcopal church , african methodist episcopal zion church , african union methodist protestant church , christian methodist episcopal church , and union american methodist episcopal church , in which these churches agreed to recognize each other 's churches , share sacraments , and affirm their clergy and ministries
like many other mainline protestant denominations in the united states , the united methodist church has experienced significant membership losses in recent decades at the time of its formation , the umc had about 11 million members in nearly 42 , 000 congregations in 1975 , membership dropped below 10 million for the first time in 2005 , there were about 8 million members in over 34 , 000 congregations membership is concentrated primarily in the midwest and in the south texas has the largest number of members , with about 1 million the states with the highest membership rates are oklahoma , iowa , mississippi , west virginia , and north carolina
by the opening of the 2008 general conference , total umc membership was estimated at 11 4 million , with about 7 9 million in the u s and 3 5 million overseas significantly , about 20 of the conference delegates were from africa , with filipinos and europeans making up another 10 during the conference , the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the methodist church of the ivory coast and its 700 , 000 members into the denomination given current trends in the umc with overseas churches growing , especially in africa , and u s churches collectively losing about 1 , 000 members a week it has been estimated that africans will make up at least 30 of the delegates at the 2012 general conference , and it is also possible that 40 of the delegates will be from outside the u s one congolese bishop has estimated that typical sunday attendance of the umc is higher in his country than in the entire united states
the umc is also a member of the wesleyan holiness consortium , which seeks to reconceive and promote biblical holiness in today 's church it is also active in the world methodist council , an interdenominational group composed of various churches in the tradition of john wesley to promote the gospel throughout the world on july 18 , 2006 , delegates to the world methodist council voted unanimously to adopt the joint declaration on the doctrine of justification , which was approved in 1999 by the vatican and the lutheran world federation
the french and indian war \( 1754 1763 \) was the north american theater of the worldwide seven years' war the war was fought between the colonies of british america and new france , with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of great britain and france , as well as native american allies at the start of the war , the french north american colonies had a population of roughly 60 , 000 european settlers , compared with 2 million in the british north american colonies the outnumbered french particularly depended on the indians long in conflict , the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756 , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict
the war was fought primarily along the frontiers between new france and the british colonies , from virginia in the south to nova scotia in the north it began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the allegheny and monongahela rivers , called the forks of the ohio , and the site of the french fort duquesne and present day pittsburgh , pennsylvania the dispute erupted into violence in the battle of jumonville glen in may 1754 , during which virginia militiamen under the command of 22 year old george washington ambushed a french patrol
in 1755 , six colonial governors in north america met with general edward braddock , the newly arrived british army commander , and planned a four way attack on the french none succeeded and the main effort by braddock was a disaster he was defeated in the battle of the monongahela on july 9 , 1755 and died a few days later british operations in 1755 , 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of pennsylvania and new york all failed , due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , and effective canadian scouts , french regular forces , and indian warrior allies in 1755 , the british captured fort beaus jour on the border separating nova scotia from acadia soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the acadians orders for the deportation were given by william shirley , commander in chief , north america , without direction from great britain the acadians , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to his britannic majesty , were expelled native americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from new england
after the disastrous 1757 british campaigns \( resulting in a failed expedition against louisbourg and the siege of fort william henry , which was followed by indian torture and massacres of british victims \) , the british government fell william pitt came to power and significantly increased british military resources in the colonies at a time when france was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in new france france concentrated its forces against prussia and its allies in the european theatre of the war between 1758 and 1760 , the british military launched a campaign to capture the colony of canada they succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately quebec though the british were later defeated at sainte foy in quebec , the french ceded canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty
the outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of anglo french conflict france ceded its territory east of the mississippi to great britain it ceded french louisiana west of the mississippi river \( including new orleans \) to its ally spain , in compensation for spain 's loss to britain of florida \( spain had ceded this to britain in exchange for the return of havana , cuba \) france 's colonial presence north of the caribbean was reduced to the islands of saint pierre and miquelon , confirming britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern north america
the conflict is known by multiple names in british america , wars were often named after the sitting british monarch , such as king william 's war or queen anne 's war as there had already been a king george 's war in the 1740s , british colonists named the second war in king george 's reign after their opponents , and it became known as the french and indian war this traditional name continues as the standard in the united states , but it obscures the fact that indians fought on both sides of the conflict , and that this was part of the seven years' war , a much larger conflict between france and great britain american historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the seven years' war other , less frequently used names for the war include the fourth intercolonial war and the great war for the empire
in europe , the north american theater of the seven years' war usually is not given a separate name the entire international conflict is known as the seven years' war seven years refers to events in europe , from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763 these dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland north america , where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years , from the battle of jumonville glen in 1754 to the capture of montreal in 1760
the french population numbered about 75 , 000 and was heavily concentrated along the st lawrence river valley , with some also in acadia \( present day new brunswick and parts of nova scotia , including le royale \( present day cape breton island \) \) fewer lived in new orleans , biloxi , mississippi , mobile , alabama and small settlements in the illinois country , hugging the east side of the mississippi river and its tributaries french fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the st lawrence and mississippi watersheds , did business with local tribes , and often married indian women traders married daughters of chiefs , creating high ranking unions
british settlers outnumbered the french 20 to 1 with a population of about 1 5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent , from nova scotia and newfoundland in the north , to georgia in the south many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west , as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time their provincial charters were granted while their population centers were along the coast , the settlements were growing into the interior nova scotia , which had been captured from france in 1713 , still had a significant french speaking population britain also claimed rupert 's land , where the hudson 's bay company traded for furs with local tribes
in between the french and the british , large areas were dominated by native tribes to the north , the mi'kmaq and the abenaki were engaged in father le loutre 's war and still held sway in parts of nova scotia , acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of canada , as well as much of present day maine the iroquois confederation dominated much of present day upstate new york and the ohio country , although the latter also included algonquian speaking populations of delaware and shawnee , as well as iroquoian speaking mingo these tribes were formally under iroquois rule , and were limited by them in authority to make agreements
further south the southeast interior was dominated by siouan speaking catawba , muskogee speaking creek and choctaw , and the iroquoian speaking cherokee tribes when war broke out , the french used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the great lakes region \( an area not directly subject to the conflict between the french and british \) , including the huron , mississauga , ojibwa , winnebago , and potawatomi the british were supported in the war by the iroquois six nations , and also by the cherokee until differences sparked the anglo cherokee war in 1758 in 1758 the pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the treaty of easton , in which a number of tribes in the ohio country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations most of the other northern tribes sided with the french , their primary trading partner and supplier of arms the creek and cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the french and british to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict it was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the other side of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements , as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare
at the start of the war , no french regular army troops were stationed in north america , and few british troops new france was defended by about 3 , 000 troupes de la marine , companies of colonial regulars \( some of whom had significant woodland combat experience \) the colonial government recruited militia support when needed most british colonies mustered local militia companies , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , to deal with native threats , but did not have any standing forces
c loron 's expedition force consisted of about 200 troupes de la marine and 30 indians the expedition covered about 3 , 000 miles \( 4 , 800 km \) between june and november 1749 it went up the st lawrence , continued along the northern shore of lake ontario , crossed the portage at niagara , and followed the southern shore of lake erie at the chautauqua portage \( near present day barcelona , new york \) , the expedition moved inland to the allegheny river , which it followed to the site of present day pittsburgh there c loron buried lead plates engraved with the french claim to the ohio country whenever he encountered british merchants or fur traders , c loron informed them of the french claims on the territory and told them to leave
when c loron 's expedition arrived at logstown , the native americans in the area informed c loron that they owned the ohio country and that they would trade with the british regardless of the french c loron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the ohio and the miami rivers , which lay just south of the village of pickawillany , the home of the miami chief known as old briton c loron threatened old briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the british old briton ignored the warning disappointed , c loron returned to montreal in november 1749
in his extensively detailed report , c loron wrote , all i can say is that the natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the french , and are entirely devoted to the english i do n't know in what way they could be brought back even before his return to montreal , reports on the situation in the ohio country were making their way to london and paris , each side proposing that action be taken william shirley , the expansionist governor of the province of massachusetts bay , was particularly forceful , stating that british colonists would not be safe as long as the french were present conflicts between the colonies , accomplished through raiding parties that included indian allies , had taken place for decades , leading to a brisk trade in european colonial captives from either side
in 1749 the british government gave land to the ohio company of virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the ohio country the grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory , and construct a fort for their protection but , as the territory was also claimed by pennsylvania , both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims in 1750 christopher gist , acting on behalf of both virginia and the company , explored the ohio territory and opened negotiations with the indian tribes at logstown he completed the 1752 treaty of logstown in which the local indians , through their half king tanacharison and an iroquois representative , agreed to terms that included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the monongahela river \( the site of present day pittsburgh , pennsylvania \) by the late 17th century , the iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the ohio valley , and kept it as hunting ground by right of conquest
the war of the austrian succession \( whose north american theater is known as king george 's war \) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the treaty of aix la chapelle the treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in europe the issues of conflicting territorial claims between british and french colonies in north america were turned over to a commission to resolve , but it reached no decision frontiers from between nova scotia and acadia in the north , to the ohio country in the south , were claimed by both sides the disputes also extended into the atlantic ocean , where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the grand banks off newfoundland
on march 17 , 1752 , the governor general of new france , marquis de la jonqui re , died and was temporarily replaced by charles le moyne de longueuil his permanent replacement , the marquis duquesne , did not arrive in new france until 1752 to take over the post the continuing british activity in the ohio territories prompted longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of charles michel de langlade , an officer in the troupes de la marine langlade was given 300 men , including french canadians and warriors of the ottawa his objective was to punish the miami people of pickawillany for not following c loron 's orders to cease trading with the british on june 21 , the french war party attacked the trading centre at pickawillany , capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the miami nation , including old briton he was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some aboriginal members of the expedition
in the spring of 1753 , paul marin de la malgue was given command of a 2 , 000 man force of troupes de la marine and indians his orders were to protect the king 's land in the ohio valley from the british marin followed the route that c loron had mapped out four years earlier , but where c loron had limited the record of french claims to the burial of lead plates , marin constructed and garrisoned forts he first constructed fort presque isle \( near present day erie , pennsylvania \) on lake erie 's south shore he had a road built to the headwaters of leboeuf creek marin constructed a second fort at fort le boeuf \( present day waterford , pennsylvania \) , designed to guard the headwaters of leboeuf creek as he moved south , he drove off or captured british traders , alarming both the british and the iroquois tanaghrisson , a chief of the mingo , who were remnants of iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion he intensely disliked the french \( whom he accused of killing and eating his father \) traveling to fort le boeuf , he threatened the french with military action , which marin contemptuously dismissed
the iroquois sent runners to the manor of william johnson in upstate new york the british superintendent for indian affairs in the new york region and beyond , johnson was known to the iroquois as warraghiggey , meaning he who does great things he spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the iroquois confederacy in the area in 1746 , johnson was made a colonel of the iroquois later he was commissioned as a colonel of the western new york militia they met at albany , new york with governor clinton and officials from some of the other american colonies mohawk chief hendrick , speaker of their tribal council , insisted that the british abide by their obligations and block french expansion when clinton did not respond to his satisfaction , chief hendrick said that the covenant chain , a long standing friendly relationship between the iroquois confederacy and the british crown , was broken
governor robert dinwiddie of virginia was an investor in the ohio company , which stood to lose money if the french held their claim to counter the french military presence in ohio , in october 1753 dinwiddie ordered the 21 year old major george washington \( whose brother was another ohio company investor \) of the virginia regiment to warn the french to leave virginia territory washington left with a small party , picking up along the way jacob van braam as an interpreter christopher gist , a company surveyor working in the area and a few mingo led by tanaghrisson on december 12 , washington and his men reached fort le boeuf
jacques legardeur de saint pierre , who succeeded marin as commander of the french forces after the latter died on october 29 , invited washington to dine with him over dinner , washington presented saint pierre with the letter from dinwiddie demanding an immediate french withdrawal from the ohio country saint pierre said , as to the summons you send me to retire , i do not think myself obliged to obey it he told washington that france 's claim to the region was superior to that of the british , since ren robert cavelier , sieur de la salle had explored the ohio country nearly a century earlier
even before washington returned , dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under william trent to that point , where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort governor duquesne sent additional french forces under claude pierre pecaudy de contrec ur to relieve saint pierre during the same period , and contrec ur led 500 men south from fort venango on april 5 , 1754 when these forces arrived at the fort on april 16 , contrec ur generously allowed trent 's small company to withdraw he purchased their construction tools to continue building what became fort duquesne
after washington had returned to williamsburg , dinwiddie ordered him to lead a larger force to assist trent in his work while en route , washington learned of trent 's retreat since tanaghrisson had promised support to the british , washington continued toward fort duquesne and met with the mingo leader learning of a french scouting party in the area , washington , with tanaghrisson and his party , surprised the canadians on may 28 in what became known as the battle of jumonville glen they killed many of the canadians , including their commanding officer , joseph coulon de jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by tanaghrisson with a tomahawk the historian fred anderson suggests that tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the british and regain authority over his own people they had been inclined to support the french , with whom they had long trading relationships one of tanaghrisson 's men told contrecoeur that jumonville had been killed by british musket fire
news of the two battles reached england in august after several months of negotiations , the government of the duke of newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the french they chose major general edward braddock to lead the expedition word of the british military plans leaked to france well before braddock 's departure for north america in response , king louis xv dispatched six regiments to new france under the command of baron dieskau in 1755 the british , intending to blockade french ports , sent out their fleet in february 1755 , but the french fleet had already sailed admiral edward hawke detached a fast squadron to north america in an attempt to intercept the french
an early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the albany congress in june and july , 1754 the goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding the plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the war of independence
braddock \( with george washington as one of his aides \) led about 1 , 500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in june 1755 to take fort duquesne the expedition was a disaster it was attacked by french and indian soldiers ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs braddock called for a retreat he was killed approximately 1 , 000 british soldiers were killed or injured the remaining 500 british troops , led by george washington , retreated to virginia two future opponents in the american revolutionary war , washington and thomas gage , played key roles in organizing the retreat
the french acquired a copy of the british war plans , including the activities of shirley and johnson shirley 's efforts to fortify oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by shirley 's inexperience in managing large expeditions in conjunction , shirley was made aware that the french were massing for an attack on fort oswego in his absence when he planned to attack fort niagara as a response , shirley left garrisons at oswego , fort bull , and fort williams \( the latter two located on the oneida carry between the mohawk river and wood creek at present day rome , new york \) supplies for use in the projected attack on niagara were cached at fort bull
johnson 's expedition was better organized than shirley 's , which was noticed by new france 's governor , the marquis de vaudreuil he had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the ohio , and had sent baron dieskau to lead the defenses at frontenac against shirley 's expected attack when johnson was seen as the larger threat , vaudreuil sent dieskau to fort st fr d ric to meet that threat dieskau planned to attack the british encampment at fort edward at the upper end of navigation on the hudson river , but johnson had strongly fortified it , and dieskau 's indian support was reluctant to attack the two forces finally met in the bloody battle of lake george between fort edward and fort william henry the battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field johnson 's advance stopped at fort william henry , and the french withdrew to ticonderoga point , where they began the construction of fort carillon \( later renamed fort ticonderoga after british capture in 1759 \)
colonel monckton , in the sole british success that year , captured fort beaus jour in june 1755 , cutting the french fortress at louisbourg off from land based reinforcements to cut vital supplies to louisbourg , nova scotia 's governor charles lawrence ordered the deportation of the french speaking acadian population from the area monckton 's forces , including companies of rogers' rangers , forcibly removed thousands of acadians , chasing down many who resisted , and sometimes committing atrocities more than any other factor , the cutting off of supplies to louisbourg led to its demise the acadian resistance , in concert with native allies , including the mi'kmaq , was sometimes quite stiff , with ongoing frontier raids \( against dartmouth and lunenburg among others \) other than the campaigns to expel the acadians \( ranging around the bay of fundy , on the petitcodiac and st john rivers , and le saint jean \) , the only clashes of any size were at petitcodiac in 1755 and at bloody creek near annapolis royal in 1757
following the death of braddock , william shirley assumed command of british forces in north america at a meeting in albany in december 1755 , he laid out his plans for 1756 in addition to renewing the efforts to capture niagara , crown point and duquesne , he proposed attacks on fort frontenac on the north shore of lake ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the maine district and down the chaudi re river to attack the city of quebec bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others , including william johnson and new york 's governor sir charles hardy , shirley 's plan had little support
newcastle replaced him in january 1756 with lord loudoun , with major general james abercrombie as his second in command neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers france sent to north america french regular army reinforcements arrived in new france in may 1756 , led by major general louis joseph de montcalm and seconded by the chevalier de l vis and colonel fran ois charles de bourlamaque , all experienced veterans from the war of the austrian succession during that time in europe , on may 18 , 1756 , england formally declared war on france , which expanded the war into europe , which was later to be known as the seven years' war
governor vaudreuil , who harboured ambitions to become the french commander in chief \( in addition to his role as governor \) , acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived scouts had reported the weakness of the british supply chain , so he ordered an attack against the forts shirley had erected at the oneida carry in the march battle of fort bull , french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45 , 000 pounds of gunpowder they set back any british hopes for campaigns on lake ontario , and endangered the oswego garrison , already short on supplies french forces in the ohio valley also continued to intrigue with indians throughout the area , encouraging them to raid frontier settlements this led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers , with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action
the new british command was not in place until july when he arrived in albany , abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until loudoun approved them montcalm took bold action against his inertia building on vaudreuil 's work harassing the oswego garrison , montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to ticonderoga , as if to presage another attack along lake george with abercrombie pinned down at albany , montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on oswego in august in the aftermath , montcalm and the indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects the europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables , which angered the indians
loudoun , a capable administrator but a cautious field commander , planned one major operation for 1757 an attack on new france 's capital , quebec leaving a sizable force at fort william henry to distract montcalm , he began organizing for the expedition to quebec he was then ordered by william pitt , the secretary of state responsible for the colonies , to attack louisbourg first beset by delays of all kinds , the expedition was finally ready to sail from halifax , nova scotia in early august in the meantime french ships had escaped the british blockade of the french coast , and a fleet outnumbering the british one awaited loudoun at louisbourg faced with this strength , loudoun returned to new york amid news that a massacre had occurred at fort william henry
french irregular forces \( canadian scouts and indians \) harassed fort william henry throughout the first half of 1757 in january they ambushed british rangers near ticonderoga in february they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen lake george , destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification in early august , montcalm and 7 , 000 troops besieged the fort , which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole when the withdrawal began , some of montcalm 's indian allies , angered at the lost opportunity for loot , attacked the british column , killing and capturing several hundred men , women , children , and slaves the aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote indian populations as some indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to european carriers
vaudreuil and montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the british blockade of the french coastline limited french shipping the situation in new france was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of fran ois bigot , the intendant of the territory his schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates a massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758 while many parties to the conflict blamed others \( the indians blamed the french for bringing bad medicine as well as denying them prizes at fort william henry \) , the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at william henry after the battle montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the st lawrence , with primary defenses at carillon , quebec , and louisbourg , while vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years
the british failures in north america , combined with other failures in the european theater , led to the fall from power of newcastle and his principal military advisor , the duke of cumberland newcastle and pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which pitt dominated the military planning he embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by loudoun he had been replaced by abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757 pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops , supported by the provincial militias , aimed at capturing the heartlands of new france two of the expeditions were successful , with fort duquesne and louisbourg falling to sizable british forces
the third invasion was stopped with the improbable french victory in the battle of carillon , in which 3 , 600 frenchmen famously and decisively defeated abercrombie 's force of 18 , 000 regulars , militia and native american allies outside the fort the french called carillon and the british called ticonderoga abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent john bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed fort frontenac , including caches of supplies destined for new france 's western forts and furs destined for europe abercrombie was recalled and replaced by jeffery amherst , victor at louisbourg
in the aftermath of generally poor french results in most theaters of the seven years' war in 1758 , france 's new foreign minister , the duc de choiseul , decided to focus on an invasion of britain , to draw british resources away from north america and the european mainland the invasion failed both militarily and politically , as pitt again planned significant campaigns against new france , and sent funds to britain 's ally on the mainland , prussia , and the french navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at lagos and quiberon bay in one piece of good fortune , some french supply ships managed to depart france , eluding the british blockade of the french coast
british victories continued in all theaters in the annus mirabilis of 1759 , when they finally captured ticonderoga , james wolfe defeated montcalm at quebec \( in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders \) , and victory at fort niagara successfully cut off the french frontier forts further to the west and south the victory was made complete in 1760 when , despite losing outside quebec city in the battle of sainte foy , the british were able to prevent the arrival of french relief ships in the naval battle of the restigouche while armies marched on montreal from three sides
in september 1760 , and before any hostilities erupted , governor vaudreuil negotiated from montreal a capitulation with general amherst amherst granted vaudreuil 's request that any french residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their roman catholic tradition , continued ownership of their property , and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes the british provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded french soldiers and french regular troops were returned to france aboard british ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war
the war in north america officially ended with the signing of the treaty of paris on 10 february 1763 , and war in the european theatre of the seven years' war was settled by the treaty of hubertusburg on 15 february 1763 the british offered france the choice of surrendering either its continental north american possessions east of the mississippi or the caribbean islands of guadeloupe and martinique , which had been occupied by the british france chose to cede the former , but was able to negotiate the retention of saint pierre and miquelon , two small islands in the gulf of st lawrence , along with fishing rights in the area they viewed the economic value of the caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent the contemporaneous french philosopher voltaire referred to canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow the british , for their part , were happy to take new france , as defence of their north american colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar spain , which traded florida to britain to regain cuba , also gained louisiana , including new orleans , from france in compensation for its losses great britain and spain also agreed that navigation on the mississippi river was to be open to vessels of all nations
britain gained control of french canada and acadia , colonies containing approximately 80 , 000 primarily french speaking roman catholic residents the deportation of acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from europe and the colonies further south the british resettled many acadians throughout its north american provinces , but many went to france , and some went to new orleans , which they had expected to remain french some were sent to colonize places as diverse as french guiana and the falkland islands these latter efforts were unsuccessful others migrated to places like saint domingue , and fled to new orleans after the haitian revolution the louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern cajun population \( the french word acadien evolved to cadien , then to cajun \)
following the treaty , king george iii issued the royal proclamation of 1763 on october 7 , 1763 , which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern canada and the first nations included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the appalachian mountains to its indian population , a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward bound settlers the proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the roman catholic canadians when accommodations were made in the quebec act in 1774 to address this and other issues , religious concerns were raised in the largely protestant thirteen colonies over the advance of popery the act maintained french civil law , including the seigneurial system , a medieval code soon to be removed from france within a generation by the french revolution
for many native populations , the elimination of french power in north america meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to british expansion , leading to their ultimate dispossession the ohio country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by braddock and forbes although the spanish takeover of the louisiana territory \( which was not completed until 1769 \) had modest repercussions , the british takeover of spanish florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the british , and a rise in tensions between the choctaw and the creek , historic enemies whose divisions the british at times exploited the change of control in florida also prompted most of its spanish catholic population to leave most went to cuba , including the entire governmental records from st augustine , although some christianized yamasee were resettled to the coast of mexico
philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force in part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non obvious force of friction , and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by galileo galilei and sir isaac newton with his mathematical insight , sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved on for nearly three hundred years by the early 20th century , einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia
with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light , particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed only four main interactions are known in order of decreasing strength , they are strong , electromagnetic , weak , and gravitational 2 10 79 high energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different natural places therein aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their natural place \( e g , for heavy bodies to fall \) , which led to natural motion , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force this theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows the place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target this explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general
the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei , who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century he showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force , for example friction
newton 's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force this law is an extension of galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force \( see a more detailed description of this below \) newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium natural state in place of the aristotelian idea of the natural state of rest that is , the first law contradicts the intuitive aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity by making rest physically indistinguishable from non zero constant velocity , newton 's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities specifically , in systems where objects are moving with different velocities , it is impossible to determine which object is in motion and which object is at rest in other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a galilean transformation
for instance , while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity , the laws of physics do not change from being at rest a person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving this is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle it is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle 's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down from the perspective of the person in the car , the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest it is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest , the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest
the concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , even those that are not strictly constant velocity the rotational inertia of planet earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year albert einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration , such as those free falling toward a gravitating object , were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames this is why , for example , astronauts experience weightlessness when in free fall orbit around the earth , and why newton 's laws of motion are more easily discernible in such environments if an astronaut places an object with mass in mid air next to himself , it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia this is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame this principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity
newton 's second law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements however , while kinematics are well described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics , there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass general relativity offers an equivalence between space time and mass , but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity , it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales with some justification , newton 's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality the relative units of force and mass then are fixed
newton 's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies , note 3 and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body whenever a first body exerts a force f on a second body , the second body exerts a force f on the first body f and f are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction this law is sometimes referred to as the action reaction law , with f called the action and f the reaction the action and the reaction are simultaneous
this means that in a closed system of particles , there are no internal forces that are unbalanced that is , the action reaction force shared between any two objects in a closed system will not cause the center of mass of the system to accelerate the constituent objects only accelerate with respect to each other , the system itself remains unaccelerated alternatively , if an external force acts on the system , then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system 19 1
since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls , this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces as with other physical concepts \( e g temperature \) , the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics
forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is because of these characteristics , forces are classified as vector quantities this means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction \( denoted scalar quantities \) for example , when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object , it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result if both of these pieces of information are not known for each force , the situation is ambiguous for example , if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling , it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be the two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction in this simple one dimensional example , without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other associating forces with vectors avoids such problems
historically , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities they have magnitude and direction when two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant \( also called the net force \) , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram the magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum , depending on the angle between their lines of action however , if the forces are acting on an extended body , their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body
as well as being added , forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces , one pointing north , and one pointing east summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions this is because , for orthogonal components , the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable , since that force would then have only one non zero component orthogonal force vectors can be three dimensional with the third component being at right angles to the other two
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction , generated between the object and the table surface for a situation with no movement , the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration the static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object
a static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces , using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances for example , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the spring reaction force , which equals the object 's weight using such tools , some quantitative force laws were discovered that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density \( widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights \) archimedes' principle for buoyancy archimedes' analysis of the lever boyle 's law for gas pressure and hooke 's law for springs these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws of motion
dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an absolute rest frame did not exist galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest this was contrary to aristotle 's notion of a natural state of rest that objects with mass naturally approached simple experiments showed that galileo 's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct for example , if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow 's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity , aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it thus , in an aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship however , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls , the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls thus , no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity
a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction in such a situation , a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force this results in zero net force , but since the object started with a non zero velocity , it continues to move with a non zero velocity aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force however , when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion
the notion force keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics , though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the schr dinger equation instead of newtonian equations this has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes quantized , i e they appear in discrete portions this is , of course , difficult to imagine in the context of forces however , the potentials v \( x , y , z \) or fields , from which the forces generally can be derived , are treated similar to classical position variables , i e ,
however , already in quantum mechanics there is one caveat , namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable , but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum like variable called the spin , and there is the pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables depending on the value of the spin , identical particles split into two different classes , fermions and bosons if two identical fermions \( e g electrons \) have a symmetric spin function \( e g parallel spins \) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric \( i e they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force \) , and vice versa , i e for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric \( i e the apparent force must be attractive \) thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables , whereas for two bosons \( e g quanta of electromagnetic waves , photons \) the correlation is strictly positive
in modern particle physics , forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by product of exchange of momentum carrying gauge bosons with the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum \( 4 momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics \) the conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be fundamental interactions 199 128 when particle a emits \( creates \) or absorbs \( annihilates \) virtual particle b , a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle a making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles a a' exchanging by b this description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of feynman diagrams in a feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line \( see world line \) traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram matter and anti matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the feynman diagram world lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices , and the feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and , in the case of virtual particle exchange , are absorbed at an adjacent vertex
all of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions the strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances , and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles , including nucleons and compound nuclei the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses all other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions for example , friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces , and the pauli exclusion principle , which does not permit atoms to pass through each other similarly , the forces in springs , modeled by hooke 's law , are the result of electromagnetic forces and the exclusion principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference 12 11 359
the development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas for example , isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation michael faraday and james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism in the 20th century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces \( all except gravity \) are manifestations of matter \( fermions \) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons this standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation the complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved higgs mechanism , but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete a grand unified theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics physicists are still attempting to develop self consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything einstein tried and failed at this endeavor , but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory 212 219
what we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of isaac newton before newton , the tendency for objects to fall towards the earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object today , this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the earth is usually designated as and has a magnitude of about 9 81 meters per second squared \( this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location \) , and points toward the center of the earth this observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the earth 's surface is directly proportional to the object 's mass thus an object that has a mass of will experience a force
newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances in particular , newton determined that the acceleration of the moon around the earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law further , newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass \( \) and the radius \( \) of the earth to the gravitational acceleration
in this equation , a dimensional constant is used to describe the relative strength of gravity this constant has come to be known as newton 's universal gravitation constant , though its value was unknown in newton 's lifetime not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make the first measurement of using a torsion balance this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the earth since knowing could allow one to solve for the earth 's mass given the above equation newton , however , realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion , his law of gravity had to be universal succinctly stated , newton 's law of gravitation states that the force on a spherical object of mass due to the gravitational pull of mass is
it was only the orbit of the planet mercury that newton 's law of gravitation seemed not to fully explain some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet \( vulcan \) that would explain the discrepancies however , despite some early indications , no such planet could be found when albert einstein formulated his theory of general relativity \( gr \) he turned his attention to the problem of mercury 's orbit and found that his theory added a correction , which could account for the discrepancy this was the first time that newton 's theory of gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative
since then , and so far , general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity in gr , gravitation is not viewed as a force , but rather , objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space time defined as the shortest space time path between two space time events from the perspective of the object , all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object 's curved path thus , the straight line path in space time is seen as a curved line in space , and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object for example , a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola , as it is in a uniform gravitational field its space time trajectory \( when the extra ct dimension is added \) is almost a straight line , slightly curved \( with the radius of curvature of the order of few light years \) the time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as gravitational force
through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge , a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz 's law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field the connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge this force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force \( due to the electric field \) and the magnetic force \( due to the magnetic field \) fully stated , this is the law
the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations , which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs these maxwell equations fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges , and the interactions of the fields themselves this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be self generating through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light this insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum
however , attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations , the photoelectric effect , and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe , proved troublesome through the work of leading theoretical physicists , a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics this final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics \( or qed \) , which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave particles known as photons in qed , photons are the fundamental exchange particle , which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force note 4
it is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force however , these characteristics actually result from the pauli exclusion principle citation needed since electrons are fermions , they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons when the electrons in a material are densely packed together , there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all , so some of them must be in higher energy states this means that it takes energy to pack them together while this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force , it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states
the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles however , a residual of the force is observed between hadrons \( the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei \) as the nuclear force here the strong force acts indirectly , transmitted as gluons , which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons , which classically transmit the nuclear force \( see this topic for more \) the failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable this phenomenon is called color confinement
the weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy w and z bosons its most familiar effect is beta decay \( of neutrons in atomic nuclei \) and the associated radioactivity the word weak derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force still , it is stronger than gravity over short distances a consistent electroweak theory has also been developed , which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the big bang
the normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact when their electron clouds overlap , pauli repulsion \( due to fermionic nature of electrons \) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects 93 the normal force , for example , is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object an example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface
tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless , frictionless , unbreakable , and unstretchable they can be combined with ideal pulleys , which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string , any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set up that uses movable pulleys , the tension force on a load can be multiplied for every string that acts on a load , another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load however , even though such machines allow for an increase in force , there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load these tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine
newton 's laws and newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three dimensional objects however , in real life , matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object for situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow , contract , expand , or otherwise change shape , the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material for example , in extended fluids , differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows
where is the relevant cross sectional area for the volume for which the stress tensor is being calculated this formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross sectional area \( the matrix diagonals of the tensor \) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross sectional area \( the off diagonal elements \) the stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains \( deformations \) including also tensile stresses and compressions 133 134 38 1 38 11
torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position , angular velocity for velocity , and angular momentum for momentum as a consequence of newton 's first law of motion , there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque likewise , newton 's second law of motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body
where is the mass of the object , is the velocity of the object and is the distance to the center of the circular path and is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object \( magnitude of the velocity \) , but only the direction of the velocity vector the unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path , and one that is tangential to the path this yields both the tangential force , which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up , and the radial \( centripetal \) force , which changes its direction
a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms this means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system the force , therefore , is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space , and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area
for certain physical scenarios , it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials this is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates for example , friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag however , for any sufficiently detailed description , all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials
the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics in macroscopic closed systems , nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system , and are often associated with the transfer of heat according to the second law of thermodynamics , nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases
the pound force has a metric counterpart , less commonly used than the newton the kilogram force \( kgf \) \( sometimes kilopond \) , is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass the kilogram force leads to an alternate , but rarely used unit of mass the metric slug \( sometimes mug or hyl \) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m s 2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf the kilogram force is not a part of the modern si system , and is generally deprecated however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight , jet thrust , bicycle spoke tension , torque wrench settings and engine output torque other arcane units of force include the sth ne , which is equivalent to 1000 n , and the kip , which is equivalent to 1000 lbf
