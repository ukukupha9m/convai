We experience conversational artificial intelligence increasingly often, from bots that we can chat with on messaging apps 
to personal assistants and voice control interfaces. While dialogue systems are becoming more widespread, there is still a 
great deal of work involved in making conversational intelligence more sophisticated.

To create dialogue systems, we need conversations. So this year, the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 
(NIPS) [is sponsoring](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8748) an open competition called [The Conversational Intelligence Challenge](http://convai.io/) aimed at creating a chatbot that can hold an intelligent conversation with a human partner. The event will produce evaluations of state-of-the-art dialogue 
systems and an open-source data set for the future training of end-to-end systems.

Traditionally, chatbot technology was developed using sets of conversational rules, which were fine-tuned manually. Now, 
given the availability of large collections of real human conversations on the web, it is becoming increasingly feasible to 
generate rules automatically. However, the results depend on the quantity and quality of the data used to train models. 
This is why every volunteer human evaluator is critical for the success of the competition.

“Within the first round of human evaluation, we collected 2,500 dialogues. From this data we learned that people get 
involved less in a conversation with a bot, compared to chatting with a person. When two people chat, they often exchange 
short messages, which they can interpret correctly. With bots, the vocabulary is not rich enough, and they still lack 
understanding,” says __Mikhail Burtsev__, one of the challenge organizers and the head of the Laboratory of Neural Networks and 
Deep Learning at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology ([MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/)). “We see that dialogue quality evaluations do not 
depend exclusively on whether bots understand messages correctly and respond adequately. There are other parameters at play. 
To improve the ability of bots to maintain meaningful conversation, we need to know what other factors are involved and how 
to measure them. Our aim in the pre-NIPS round of evaluation is to get at least 3,000 more dialogues to draw statistically 
sound conclusions and improve the tools for creating bots.”

The pre-NIPS human evaluation round will be held remotely from Nov. 20 to Dec. 8, 2017, via the @ConvaiBot on messaging 
platforms. Starting with these two weeks before the NIPS conference, teams and volunteers will chat with bots and perform 
quality evaluation of the teams’ solutions, which will then be adjusted over the tuning round. The final ratings of the 
submissions will be presented Dec. 8, during the competition session at NIPS. Please join our effort to create an open 
data set for the development of the next generation of conversational AI solutions and donate your dialogue via the 
@ConvaiBot on [Telegram](https://t.me/convaibot) or [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/convai.io).

Six teams from universities and companies from around the world are taking part in the competition finals: the University 
of Wroclaw, MIPT, McGill University, KAIST, AIBrain, Crosscert, UMass Lowell’s Text Machine Lab, Trinity College, the Hong 
Kong Polytechnic University, and Fudan University.

The competition is organized by MIPT, Université de Montréal, McGill University, and Carnegie Mellon University in 
partnership with Facebook, Flint Capital, IVADO, Maluuba, and Element AI.
