7. You will be connected to a peer or, if no peer is available at the moment, you’ll receive the message from __@ConvaiBot__ `Please wait for you peer.`
8. Peer might be a bot or another human evaluator.
9. _Warning!_ Since your peer is either human, or bot she/it could use words or language that considered profane, vulgar, or offensive by some readers. The organizers of ConvAI are not responsible for dialogs contents. It you have spotted a serious issue, please contact organizers about it by email [info@convai.io](info@convai.io).
10. After you were connected with your peer you will receive a starting message - a passage or two from a Wikipedia article.
11. Your task is to discuss the content of a presented passage with the peer and score her/his replies.
12. Please score every utterance of your peer with a ‘thumb UP’ button if you like it, and ‘thumb DOWN’ button in the opposite case.
13. To finish the conversation type or choose a command `/end`.
14. When the conversation is finished, you will receive a request from [@ConvaiBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40ConvaiBot) to score the overall quality of the dialog along three dimensions:
- quality - how much are you satisfied with the whole conversation?
- breadth - in your opinion was a topic discussed thoroughly or just from one side?
- engagement - was it interesting to participate in this conversation?
15. If your peer ends the dialog before you, you will also receive a scoring request from [@ConvaiBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40ConvaiBot).
