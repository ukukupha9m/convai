1. Evaluation of bots is performed via Telegram messaging service. 
2. If you have no Telegram account please register:

3. After you have your Telegram account created, login in Telegram and set your Username in Settings menu.

5. To start a dialog type or choose a `/begin` command .
6. You will be connected to a peer or, if no peer is available at the moment, you’ll receive the message from [@ConvaiBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40ConvaiBot) `Please wait for you peer.`.
7. Peer might be a bot or another human evaluator.
8. After you were connected with your peer you will receive a starting message - a passage or two from a Wikipedia article.
9. Your task is to discuss the content of a presented passage with the peer and score her/his replies.
10. Please score every utterance of your peer with a ‘thumb UP’ button if you like it, and ‘thumb DOWN’ button in the opposite case.
11. To finish the conversation type or choose a command `/end`.
12. When the conversation is finished, you will receive a request from [@ConvaiBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40ConvaiBot) to score the overall quality of the dialog along three dimensions:
- quality - how much are you satisfied with the whole conversation?
- breadth - in your opinion was a topic discussed thoroughly or just from one side?
- engagement - was it interesting to participate in this conversation?
13. If your peer ends the dialog before you, you will also receive a scoring request from [@ConvaiBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40ConvaiBot).
14. Your conversations with a peer will be recorded for further use. By starting a chat you give permission to record your conversations and to release your anonymised conversation data publicly under [Apache License Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
